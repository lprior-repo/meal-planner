Agentic workflows need repeatability, modularity, observability and cross-platform support. Dagger provides a way to build reproducible workflows in any language with custom environments, parallel processing, and seamless chaining.

This quickstart will guide you through creating and running your first AI agent with Dagger.

The agent will use an LLM of your choosing to solve a programming assignment. The agent will have access to tools to write code and validate it.
