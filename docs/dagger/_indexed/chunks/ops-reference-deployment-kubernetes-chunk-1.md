> **Context**: Deploy Dagger on a Kubernetes cluster for self-hosted CI infrastructure.


Deploy Dagger on a Kubernetes cluster for self-hosted CI infrastructure.

Running Dagger in Kubernetes is generally a good choice for:
- Teams with demanding CI/CD performance needs or regulated environments
- Individuals or teams that want to self-host their CI infrastructure
- Better integration with internal existing infrastructure
- Mitigate CI vendor lock-in
