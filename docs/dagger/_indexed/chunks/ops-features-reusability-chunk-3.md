Modules integrate seamlessly with Dagger Cloud, which offers a collaborative environment to manage modules, visualize dependencies, and trace executions.

- A dedicated **Modules** tab in Dagger Cloud: See all your organization's modules in one place, with metadata like engine versions, descriptions, and linked repositories, automatically pulled and synced from GitHub.
- Views for better organization: Create filtered views of modules by team, service, or domain.
- Documentation: See API documentation for each module and version, directly in the Dagger Cloud dashboard.
- Version-aware navigation: View active branches and tags, ordered by recency.
- Supply chain visibility: See exactly which modules your code depends on, and which depend on yours. This upstream/downstream awareness helps eliminate breakage and fosters stronger collaboration between teams.
- Trace-to-module linkage: Trace failed runs or AI workflows back to the exact module versions that caused them.
