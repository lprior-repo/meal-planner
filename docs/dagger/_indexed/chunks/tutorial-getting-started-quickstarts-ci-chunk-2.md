This quickstart will take you approximately 10 minutes to complete. You should be familiar with programming in Go, Python, TypeScript, PHP, or Java.

Before beginning, ensure that:

- you have [installed the Dagger CLI](./ops-getting-started-installation.md).
- you know [the basics of Dagger](/getting-started/quickstarts/basics).
- you have Git and a container runtime installed on your system and running.
- you have a GitHub account (optional, only if configuring Dagger Cloud)

> **Tip:** Dagger SDKs generate native code-bindings for all dependencies from the Dagger API. Setting up your IDE to work with Dagger is highly recommended.
