> **Context**: Welcome to Dagger, a general-purpose composition engine for containerized workflows.


Welcome to Dagger, a general-purpose composition engine for containerized workflows.

Dagger is a modular, composable platform designed to replace complex systems glued together with artisanal scripts - for example, complex integration testing environments, data processing pipelines, and AI agent workflows. It is open source and works with any compute platform or technology stack, automatically optimizing for speed and cost.
