# Overview

> **Context**: The Dagger API is extensible and shareable by design.


The Dagger API is extensible and shareable by design.

- You can extend the [Dagger API](./concept-getting-started-concepts.md) by creating Dagger modules
- You can also embed a [Dagger SDK](/getting-started/api/sdk) directly into your application

Both approaches let you access Dagger features for container operations, secret management, and more.
