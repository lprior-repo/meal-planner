### What API query language does Dagger use?

Dagger uses GraphQL as its low-level language-agnostic API query language.

### Do I need to know GraphQL to use Dagger?

No. You only need to know one of Dagger's supported SDKs languages to use Dagger. The translation to underlying GraphQL API calls is handled internally by the Dagger SDK of your choice.

### There's no SDK for <language> yet. Can I still use Dagger?

Yes. It's possible to use the Dagger GraphQL API from any language that [supports GraphQL](https://graphql.org/code/) or from the [Dagger CLI](./ops-getting-started-installation.md).
