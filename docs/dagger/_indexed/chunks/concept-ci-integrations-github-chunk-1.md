Dagger can directly interact with GitHub pull requests, making it easy to test the functionality of specific forks or branches of a GitHub repository.

Dagger also supports publishing container images to [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).
