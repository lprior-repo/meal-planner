# Container Runtimes

> **Context**: When the Dagger CLI is run on the host, it needs to connect to an engine. The most common way is to rely on a container runtime available on the host.


When the Dagger CLI is run on the host, it needs to connect to an engine. The most common way is to rely on a container runtime available on the host.

Dagger can be used with most OCI-compatible container runtimes, including:

- [Docker](./ops-reference-container-runtimes-docker.md)
- [Podman](./ops-reference-container-runtimes-podman.md)
- [Nerdctl / Finch](./ops-reference-container-runtimes-nerdctl.md)
- [Apple's Container](./ops-reference-container-runtimes-apple-container.md)
