[Dagger Cloud](https://dagger.cloud) provides Traces, a browser-based interface focused on tracing and debugging Dagger Functions. A Trace represents one invocation of a Dagger Function, run locally or in CI. It contains detailed information about the operations performed by the Dagger Function.

> **Info:** Dagger Cloud is a hosted service to help visualize your workflows in a friendly way. You can create a free account by visiting [dagger.cloud](https://dagger.cloud).

- Traces provides a UI to debug what went wrong when something fails, focusing on tracing what happened and when it happened
- Traces also helps you optimize your Dagger Functions as you author them, by giving you the detailed step-by-step execution of your workflow and the associated telemetry

This is equally useful for debugging workflows running on a developer's local environment and for workflows in CI environments.

This feature can also be used for end-to-end monitoring of agent prompts, tool calls, and even low-level system operations. All agent state changes are observable in real time.

#### OpenTelemetry

Dagger uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTel) as its telemetry protocol -- both the TUI and Traces are powered by OTel. Each Dagger Function call is represented as an [OpenTelemetry trace](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/). The operations performed by the Dagger Function are represented as [OpenTelemetry spans](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#spans). A span can emit several effects, which are the operations generated in the span. For example, the `withDirectory()` span generates all the necessary operations to provide a directory with excluded and included elements. For this, it first loads a directory, and then creates a new one from scratch inside the container, generating two distinct steps (effects).

Dagger is aware of the context it runs in. The Dagger Cloud dashboard classifies Traces depending on whether you triggered a run from your local development host or from your CI environment. You can select the appropriate view from the dashboard.

This initial view displays groups of Traces that belong to the same point in Git history. The grouping is determined by the branch/reference combination where Dagger was triggered. This is useful when you need to inspect all the Traces emitted at a specific, pinned point in the repository's version history

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each Trace group:

- Repository name
- Commit metadata, including comment and commit author
- Indication of the run status: in progress, succeeded, or failed
- The run start time

> **Important:** All of the information listed above may not be available for a specific group, as it differs depending on whether the Trace is generated by a local run or a CI run. When Dagger runs in a CI environment like GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, or Jenkins, additional Trace metadata is displayed based on the Git repository information available. Traces that run in CI but contain incomplete or no Git metadata are considered "orphaned" and will not be part of a group.

You can drill down into the details of a specific group by clicking it. This directs you to a timeline view consisting of a list of Traces, together with detailed status and duration metadata for each. Each Dagger Function call is represented as a separate Trace.

#### Timeline view

With the timeline view you can view:

- **Duration**: See exactly how long each Dagger Function in your workflow takes. This helps identify bottlenecks and optimize your workflows for faster execution
- **Trace details**: See all Traces in a single unified view allowing you to easily drill down into individual Traces to understand their execution
- **Failures**: Quickly pinpoint failed steps in the timeline and jump to their details immediately

You can click any of the Traces in the list to see detailed logs for each Trace. The flame graph at the top of the Trace shows the operations performed by the Dagger Function, with a visual cue of how much time each operation represents of the total duration.

Steps that are currently in progress are highlighted with a blinking or yellow indicator. This gives you a real-time view of your Trace's activity and makes it clear which processes are active. Similarly, if a step has been cancelled, it's displayed with an orange indicator. This helps you quickly distinguish interruptions or cancelled jobs when viewing a Trace.

To make it easier to navigate through Trace logs (some of which can contain thousands of lines), you can quickly search for specific keywords within a Trace log. In addition, breadcrumbs let you see the complete context of any span within the Trace all the way back to the root, allowing you to quickly jump between different parts of the log.

If there are any errors, they are now highlighted in a separate section in the Trace log, making them easier to spot immediately. The error view also provides more context around where and why the issue occurred. This means you can see not just the error, but also the related steps that led up to it.
