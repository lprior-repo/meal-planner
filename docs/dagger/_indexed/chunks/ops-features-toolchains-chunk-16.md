### Keep Toolchains Focused

Each toolchain should provide a cohesive set of related functions. Instead of creating a monolithic "everything" toolchain, create smaller, focused toolchains that teams can mix and match.

### Namespace Considerations

When naming toolchains (especially with `--name`), choose clear, descriptive names that won't conflict with your module's own functions or other toolchains.
