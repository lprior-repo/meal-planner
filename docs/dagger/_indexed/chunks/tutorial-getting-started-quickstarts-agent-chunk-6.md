Replace the generated Dagger module files as described below.

**Go (`main.go`):**
```go
package main

import (
	"dagger/coding-agent/internal/dagger"
)

type CodingAgent struct{}

// Write a Go program
func (m *CodingAgent) GoProgram(
	// The programming assignment, e.g. "write me a curl clone"
	assignment string,
) *dagger.Container {
	environment := dag.Env().
		WithStringInput("assignment", assignment, "the assignment to complete").
		WithContainerInput("builder",
			dag.Container().From("golang").WithWorkdir("/app"),
			"a container to use for building Go code").
		WithContainerOutput("completed", "the completed assignment in the Golang container")

	work := dag.LLM().
		WithEnv(environment).
		WithPrompt(`
			You are an expert Go programmer with an assignment to create a Go program
			Create files in the default directory in $builder
			Always build the code to make sure it is valid
			Do not stop until your assignment is completed and the code builds
			Your assignment is: $assignment
			`)

	return work.
		Env().
		Output("completed").
		AsContainer()
}
```

**Python (`src/coding_agent/main.py`):**
```python

    def go_program(
        self,
        assignment: str,

**TypeScript (`src/index.ts`):**
```typescript
import { dag, object, func, Container } from "@dagger.io/dagger"

@object()
export class CodingAgent {
  /**
   * Write a Go program
   */

      .withContainerOutput(
        "completed",
        "the completed assignment in the Golang container",
      )

    const work = dag
      .llm()
      .withEnv(environment)
      .withPrompt(
        `You are an expert Go programmer with an assignment to create a Go program

        Your assignment is: $assignment`,
      )

    return work.env().output("completed").asContainer()
  }
}
```

This code creates a Dagger Function called `go-program` that takes an assignment as input and returns a `Container` with the result of the assignment.

- The variable `environment` is the environment to define inputs and outputs for the agent.
- The input `builder` is a `Container`. This provides a workspace for the agent to create files and execute commands like `go build`.
- The output `completed` signals the agent that it should return a `Container` representing the completed assignment
- When the LLM decides it is finished, the `completed` container is selected from the `Env` outputs and returned.
