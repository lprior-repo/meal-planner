### args?

> `optional` **args**: `string`[]

Command to run instead of the container's default command (e.g., ["go", "run", "main.go"]).

If empty, the container's default command is used.

---

### expand?

> `optional` **expand**: `boolean`

Replace "${VAR}" or "$VAR" in the args according to the current environment variables defined in the container (e.g. "/$VAR/foo").

---

### experimentalPrivilegedNesting?

> `optional` **experimentalPrivilegedNesting**: `boolean`

Provides Dagger access to the executed command.

---

### insecureRootCapabilities?

> `optional` **insecureRootCapabilities**: `boolean`

Execute the command with all root capabilities. This is similar to running a command with "sudo" or executing "docker run" with the "--privileged" flag. Containerization does not provide any security guarantees when using this option. It should only be used when absolutely necessary and only with trusted commands.

---

### noInit?

> `optional` **noInit**: `boolean`

If set, skip the automatic init process injected into containers by default.

This should only be used if the user requires that their exec process be the pid 1 process in the container. Otherwise it may result in unexpected behavior.

---

### useEntrypoint?

> `optional` **useEntrypoint**: `boolean`

If the container has an entrypoint, prepend it to the args.
