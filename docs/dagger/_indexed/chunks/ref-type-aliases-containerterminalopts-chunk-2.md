---

### experimentalPrivilegedNesting?

> `optional` **experimentalPrivilegedNesting**: `boolean`

Provides Dagger access to the executed command.

---

### insecureRootCapabilities?

> `optional` **insecureRootCapabilities**: `boolean`

Execute the command with all root capabilities. This is similar to running a command with "sudo" or executing "docker run" with the "--privileged" flag. Containerization does not provide any security guarantees when using this option. It should only be used when absolutely necessary and only with trusted commands.
