Dagger is a platform for composing and running software engineering workflows - for example, complex integration testing environments, data processing pipelines, and AI agent workflows.

Dagger lets you build workflows from containers, LLMs, files, repositories, directories, and other resources, as reusable modules that run anywhere, with full type safety and automatic caching.

Dagger is open source and works with any compute platform or technology stack, automatically optimizing for speed and cost.

With Dagger, you:

- Write workflows once in your preferred language
- Run workflows consistently across local development, CI, and production
- Gain complete observability over workflow performance, failures and errors
