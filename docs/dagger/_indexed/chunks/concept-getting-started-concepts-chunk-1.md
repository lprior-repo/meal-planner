The Dagger API is an unified interface for composing Dagger workflows. It provides a set of functions and types for creating and managing application delivery workflows, including types for containers, files, directories, network services, secrets, and more. You can call these functions from `dagger`, the Dagger CLI, or from custom functions written in any supported programming language.
