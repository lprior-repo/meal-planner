The Dagger CLI is released in tandem with the Dagger Engine and thus shares a version number with it. Dagger SDKs automatically provision a Dagger Engine at a compatible version.

The Dagger Engine runner is distributed as a container image at `registry.dagger.io/engine`. Tags are made for the version of each release. For example, the 0.19.7 release has a corresponding image at `registry.dagger.io/engine`.

Each release notes the compatible Dagger Engine version in its release notes.
