This quickstart will take you approximately 10 minutes to complete. You should be familiar with programming in Go, Python, TypeScript, PHP, or Java.

Before beginning, ensure that:

- you have [installed the Dagger CLI](./ops-getting-started-installation.md).
- you have a container runtime installed on your system and running. This can be Docker, Podman, nerdctl, Apple Container, or other Docker-like systems.
- you have a GitHub account (optional, only if configuring Dagger Cloud).
