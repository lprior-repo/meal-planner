Dagger provides a GitHub Action that can be used in any GitHub Actions workflow to call one or more Dagger Functions on specific events, such as a new commit.

Dagger has also partnered with [Depot](https://depot.dev/) to provide managed, Dagger Powered GitHub Actions runners. These runners, which serve as drop-in replacements for GitHub's own runners, come with Dagger pre-installed and pre-configured to best practices, automatic persistent layer caching, and multi-architecture support. They make it faster and easier to run Dagger pipelines in GitHub repositories.
