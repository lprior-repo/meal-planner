### Join the Discord

Before anything, join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io). It's the best place to ask questions, get inspiration, and ask for help.

### Look for inspiration

Learn about other projects who have successfully adopted Dagger through [case studies](https://dagger.io/resources/Case-Studies) and [demo videos](https://dagger.io/resources/Videos).

### Look for red flags

Your project may not be a good fit for Dagger if:
- It is so early that it doesn't need CI
- Your *only* output is a Windows, Mac, iOS or Android application
- You are happily using a monolithic toolchain (Gradle, Nix, Bazel)
- Your workflows are heavily dependent on Windows or Mac runners
