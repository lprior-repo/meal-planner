# Type Alias: ContainerWithExecOpts

> **Context**: > **ContainerWithExecOpts** = `object`


> **ContainerWithExecOpts** = `object`

## Properties

### expand?

> `optional` **expand**: `boolean`

Replace "${VAR}" or "$VAR" in the args according to the current environment variables defined in the container (e.g. "/$VAR/foo").

---

### expect?

> `optional` **expect**: [`ReturnType`](/reference/typescript/api/client.gen/enumerations/ReturnType)

Exit codes this command is allowed to exit with without error

---

### experimentalPrivilegedNesting?

> `optional` **experimentalPrivilegedNesting**: `boolean`

Provides Dagger access to the executed command.

---

### insecureRootCapabilities?

> `optional` **insecureRootCapabilities**: `boolean`

Execute the command with all root capabilities. Like --privileged in Docker

DANGER: this grants the command full access to the host system. Only use when 1) you trust the command being executed and 2) you specifically need this level of access.

---

### noInit?

> `optional` **noInit**: `boolean`

Skip the automatic init process injected into containers by default.

Only use this if you specifically need the command to be pid 1 in the container. Otherwise it may result in unexpected behavior. If you're not sure, you don't need this.

---

### redirectStderr?

> `optional` **redirectStderr**: `string`

Redirect the command's standard error to a file in the container. Example: "./stderr.txt"

---

### redirectStdin?

> `optional` **redirectStdin**: `string`

Redirect the command's standard input from a file in the container. Example: "./stdin.txt"

---

### redirectStdout?

> `optional` **redirectStdout**: `string`

Redirect the command's standard output to a file in the container. Example: "./stdout.txt"

---

### stdin?

> `optional` **stdin**: `string`

Content to write to the command's standard input. Example: "Hello world")

---

### useEntrypoint?

> `optional` **useEntrypoint**: `boolean`

Apply the OCI entrypoint, if present, by prepending it to the args. Ignored by default.
