## Design for AI + Humans

Each doc:
- **Answers one question clearly**
- **Links to 2-3 related docs** (so you never get stuck)
- **Uses headings, tables, code** (scannable for humans, structured for AI)
- **Stays under 1500 words** (focused, no walls of text)
- **Points to next steps** (clear navigation)

See: [AI_DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM.md](AI_DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM.md) for how this works
