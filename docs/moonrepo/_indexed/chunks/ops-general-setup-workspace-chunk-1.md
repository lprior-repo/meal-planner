Once moon has been installed, we must setup the workspace, which is denoted by the `.moon` folder — this is known as the workspace root. The workspace is in charge of:

-   Integrating with a version control system.
-   Defining configuration that applies to its entire tree.
-   Housing projects to build a project graph.
-   Running tasks with the action graph.
