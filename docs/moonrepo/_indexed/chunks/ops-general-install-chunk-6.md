## Canary releases

moon supports canary releases, which are built and published for every commit to our development branches. These releases will include features and functionality that have not yet landed on master. When using a canary release, you'll need to download and execute the binaries manually:

-   Using our npm package [`@moonrepo/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonrepo/cli?activeTab=versions) under the `canary` tag. Releases are versioned by date.
-   From a [GitHub prerelease](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/canary) using the `canary` tag. This tag always represents the latest development release.
