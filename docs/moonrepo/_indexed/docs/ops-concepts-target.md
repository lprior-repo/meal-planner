# Targets

> **Context**: A target is a compound identifier that pairs a [scope](#common-scopes) to a [task](/docs/concepts/task), separated by a `:`, in the format of `scope:t

A target is a compound identifier that pairs a [scope](#common-scopes) to a [task](/docs/concepts/task), separated by a `:`, in the format of `scope:task`.

Targets are used by terminal commands...

```bash
$ moon run designSystem:build
```

And configurations for declaring cross-project or cross-task dependencies.

```yaml
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - 'designSystem:build'
```

## Common scopes

These scopes are available for both running targets and configuring them.

### By project

The most common scope is the project scope, which requires the name of a project, as defined in [`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace). When paired with a task name, it will run a specific task from that project.

```bash
## Run `lint` in project `app`
$ moon run app:lint
```

### By tag (v1.4.0)

Another way to target projects is with the tag scope, which requires the name of a tag prefixed with `#`, and will run a specific task in all projects with that tag.

```bash
## Run `lint` in projects with the tag `frontend`
$ moon run '#frontend:lint'
```

> **Caution**: Because `#` is a special character in the terminal (is considered a comment), you'll need to wrap the target in quotes, or escape it like so `\#`.

## Run scopes

These scopes are only available on the command line when running tasks with `moon run` or `moon ci`.

### All projects

For situations where you want to run a specific target in *all* projects, for example `lint`ing, you can utilize the all projects scope by omitting the project name from the target: `:lint`.

```bash
## Run `lint` in all projects
$ moon run :lint
```

### Closest project `~` (v1.33.0)

If you are within a project folder, or an arbitrarily nested folder, and want to run a task in the closest project (traversing upwards), the `~` scope can be used.

```bash
## Run `lint` in the closest project
$ moon run ~:lint
```

## Config scopes

These scopes are only available when configuring a task.

### Dependencies `^`

When you want to include a reference for each project [that's depended on](/docs/concepts/project#dependencies), you can utilize the `^` scope. This will be expanded to *all* depended on projects. If you do not want all projects, then you'll need to explicitly define them.

moon.yml

```yaml
dependsOn:
  - 'apiClients'
  - 'designSystem'

## Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - '^:build'

## Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - 'apiClients:build'
      - 'designSystem:build'
```

### Self `~`

When referring to another task within the current project, you can utilize the `~` scope, or omit the `~:` prefix altogether, which will be expanded to the current project's name. This is useful for situations where the name is unknown, for example, when configuring [`.moon/tasks.yml`](/docs/config/tasks), or if you just want a shortcut!

.moon/tasks.yml

```yaml
## Configured as
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    deps:
      - '~:typecheck'
      # OR
      - 'typecheck'
  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc'

## Resolves to (assuming project is "foo")
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    deps:
      - 'foo:typecheck'
  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc'
```
