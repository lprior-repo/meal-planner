## Create resource

Windmill provides integrations with many different apps and services with the use
of [Resources](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md). Resources are rich objects in JSON that allow to store configuration and credentials.

Each Resource has a _Resource Type_ ([PostgreSQL](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/114/postgresql), [MySQL](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/111/mysql), [MS SQL](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/132/ms_sql_server), [BigQuery](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/108/bigquery), [Snowflake](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/107/snowflake))
that defines the schema that the resource of this type needs to implement. Schemas implement the
[JSON Schema specification](https://json-schema.org/).

		description="Resources are structured configurations and connections to third-party systems, with Resource types defining the schema for each Resource."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/resources_and_types"
	/>
</div>

:::tip

You can find a list of all the officially supported Resource types on
[Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/resources).

:::

:::tip

You can pin a resource to an SQL query by adding a `-- database resource_path` line to your script. The query will automatically use the resource without having to specify it in the autogenerated user interface.

### PostgreSQL

To be able to connect to a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) instance ([Supabase](../../../integrations/supabase.md), [Neon.tech](../../../integrations/neon.md), etc.), we'll need to define a Resource with the `PostgreSQL` Resource Type first.

Head to the [Resources](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md) page, click on
"Add resource" in the top right corner and select the `PostgreSQL` type.

![Select PostgreSQL Resource Type](../../../assets/integrations/psql-1-resources.png.webp)

Fill out the form with the information of your PostgreSQL instance and "Test connection" if needed.

![Paste in Resource Values](../../../assets/integrations/psql-2-postgres-rt.png.webp)

:::tip

For testing purposes, you can use the sample PostgreSQL Resource provided to
every user. It is available under the path `f/examples/demo_windmillshowcases`.

#### PostgreSQL: Add a Supabase database

Windmill provides a wizard to easily add a [Supabase](../../../integrations/supabase.md) database through PostgreSQL.

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/supabase_wizard.mp4"
/>

<br />

When creating a new PostgreSQL resource, just "Add a Supabase DB". This will lead you to a Supabase page where
you need to pick your organization. Then on Windmill pick a database, fill with database password and that's it.

#### Use SQL to build on external APIs using Sequin

With [Sequin](https://sequin.io), developers can build on top of third-party services like Salesforce or HubSpot using SQL. More details at:

To specify the application intent for read-only requests, add `-- ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly` to the script.

:::info
When using domain credentials via Entra (Azure Active Directory) you need to add the scope `https://database.windows.net//.default` to the [Windmill OAuth instance setting](../../misc/setup_oauth#azure).
:::

### BigQuery

To be able to connect to a [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) instance, we'll need to define a Resource with the `BigQuery` Resource Type first.

Head to the [Resources](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md) page, click on
"Add resource" in the top right corner and select the `BigQuery` type.

![Select BigQuery Resource Type](./select_bigquery.png.webp)

| Property                    | Type   | Description                                    | Required |

You can directly "Test connection" if needed.

### Snowflake

To be able to connect to [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/), you can choose to either setup [OAuth for Snowflake](../../../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx#oauth) or by defining a Snowflake Resource.

If a Snowflake OAuth connection is present, you can create a new Resource by heading to [Resources](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md), clicking on "Add Resource" in the top right corner and selecting `snowflake_oauth`. Take a look at [this guide](../../../misc/9_guides/snowflake_app_with_user_roles/index.mdx#sample-app-setup) to learn more about how to build an App with Snowflake OAuth integration.

If you do not wish to use OAuth, click on "Add Resource" in the top right corner and select the `Snowflake` type instead.

![Select Snowflake Resource Type](./select_snowflake.png.webp)

| Property           | Type   | Description                                                            | Required |

| public_key         | string | Public key used for authentication.                                    | true     |
| warehouse          | string | Snowflake warehouse to be used for queries.                            | false    |
| username           | string | Username for Snowflake login.                                          | true     |
| database           | string | Name of the Snowflake database to connect to.                          | true     |
| schema             | string | Schema within the Snowflake database.                                  | false    |
| role               | string | Role to be assumed upon connection.                                    | false    |

Here's a step-by-step guide on where to find each detail.

1. **Account identifier**:

   The account identifier typically follows the format: `<orgname>-<account_name>`. You can find it in the Snowflake web interface:

   - Log in to your Snowflake account.
   - The account identifier can often be found in the URL or at the top of the Snowflake interface after you log in (in the format `https://app.snowflake.com/orgname/account_name/`).

   [Snowflake Documentation on Account Identifier](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier)

2. **Username**:

   The username is the Snowflake user you will use to connect to the database. You will need to create a user if you don't have one:

   - In the Snowflake web interface, go to the "ACCOUNT" tab.
   - Select "Users" from the left navigation pane.
   - Click the "+ CREATE USER" button to create a new user with a username and password.

3. **Public key and private key**:

   To create the public and private keys, you will need to generate them using a tool like OpenSSL:

   - Open a terminal window.
   - Use OpenSSL to generate a public and private key pair. The exact commands may vary based on your operating system.
   - For example, to generate a public key: `openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem`

   Once you have the keys, you can copy the content and paste them into the respective fields in your configuration.

   [Snowflake Documentation on Key Pair Authentication & Key Pair Rotation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth)

4. **Warehouse, schema, database, and role**:

   These parameters are specific to your Snowflake environment and will depend on how your Snowflake instance is configured:

   - `warehouse`: The name of the Snowflake warehouse you want to connect to.
   - `schema`: The name of the Snowflake schema you want to use.
   - `database`: The name of the Snowflake database you want to connect to.
   - `role`: The role you want to use for authentication.

   You can find these details in the Snowflake web interface:

   - Log in to your Snowflake account.
   - You can find the names of warehouses, schemas, databases, and roles in the interface or by running SQL queries.

You can directly "Test connection" if needed.

### Amazon Redshift

To connect to an Amazon Redshift instance, we need to add the corresponding resource. Redshift is compatible with Windmill's PostgreSQL resources and scripts, so we'll start by adding a new PostgrSQL resource type.

![Select PostgreSQL Resource Type](../../../assets/integrations/psql-1-resources.png.webp)

Get the required values from the AWS console under CLUSTERS > your Redshift cluster.

![AWS Redshift Cluster Screen](../../../assets/integrations/redshift-aws-console.png)

Find the value named 'endpoint' it should look like this:

```
default-workgroup.475893240789.us-east-1.redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com:5439/dev
```
From there you can deduce your host, port and database name:

- host: default-workgroup.475893240789.us-east-1.redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com
- port: 5439
- dbname: dev

Now you can fill those values in Windmill, fill also the user and password for the db and press "Test connection" to check that it's working.

![Fill in the required values](../../../assets/integrations/redshift-resource-filled.png)

Once it's working press save and you have succesfully added your Redshift instance as a PostgreSQL resource!

### Oracle

To be able to connect to an [Oracle database](https://www.oracle.com/database/), you need to define an Oracle resource.

Head to the [Resources](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md) page, click on
"Add resource" in the top right corner and select the `Oracle` type.

![Select Oracle Resource Type](./select_oracle.png)

| Property  | Type   | Description     | Required |
| --------- | ------ | --------------- | -------- |
| database  | string | Database name   | true     |
| user      | string | Username        | true     |
| password  | string | User's password | true     |

Here's a step-by-step guide on where to find each detail.

1. **Database**: The name of the Oracle database you want to connect to. This can be found in your Oracle database configuration or by consulting your database administrator.

2. **Username**: The username for Oracle login. You will need to create a user if you don't have one:

   - In the Oracle database interface, go to the "Users" section.
   - Create a new user with a username and password.

3. **Password**: The password associated with the Oracle username.

You can directly "Test connection" if needed.

### DuckDB

DuckDB scripts run in-memory out-of-the-box.
