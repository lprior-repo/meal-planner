## Instant preview in App editor

The app editor has several methods of previewing results instantly.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="App editor"
		description="The app editor is where you build an app with components, create interactions with runnables (scripts & flows), and configure the app settings."
		href="/docs/apps/app_editor"
		color="orange"
	/>
</div>

### Run manually a runnable

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/app_test_run.mp4"
/>

<br />

When on a runnable from the [runnable panel](../../apps/3_app-runnable-panel.mdx), you can manually run it.

### Run all

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/app_test_run_all.mp4"
/>

<br />

On the top bar of the app, you can either manually run all runnables of set a given run frequency.

### Preview

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/app_test_preview.mp4"
/>

<br />

The [preview mode](../../apps/0_toolbar.mdx#preview-mode) of the app will run all runnables before previewing them.
