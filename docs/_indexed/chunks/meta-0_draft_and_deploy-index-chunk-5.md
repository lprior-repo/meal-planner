## Diff viewer

Visualize changes between [current](#local-edits) and [latest deployed version](#deployed-version) or [latest draft](#draft) for any script, flow or app.

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/diff_viewer.mp4"
/>

<br />

> Changes can then be reversed to previous version.

<br />

You can also use the diff toggle to quickly check the code changes of an inline script, between you current and deployed version code.
