## MealMaster

Meal master can be imported by uploading one or more meal master files.
The files should either be `.txt`, `.MMF` or `.MM` files.

The MealMaster spec allows for many variations. Currently, only the one column format for ingredients is supported.
Second line notes to ingredients are currently also not imported as a note but simply put into the instructions.
If you have MealMaster recipes that cannot be imported feel free to raise an issue.
