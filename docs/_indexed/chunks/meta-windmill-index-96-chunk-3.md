## Workflows as code

One way to write distributed programs that execute distinct jobs is to use [flows](./tutorial-windmill-1-flow-editor.md) that chain scripts together.

Another approach is to write a program that defines the jobs and their dependencies, and then execute that program directly in your script. This is known as workflows as code.
