## Sharing & Autosync
If you want to collaborate on the creation and usage of the shopping list you can add a user to the list of shared users.
Each user now has access to the list and can edit it. 

When checking items in viewing mode the change is synced to all other clients that currently have the same list open.
You can set the syncing interval in your user settings.
