# Local development

> **Context**: import DocCard from '@site/src/components/DocCard';

Windmill has [its own integrated development environment](../../code_editor/index.mdx), but you can also develop and run scripts locally, both with [self-hosted](./meta-1_self_host-index.md) and cloud instances.

To simply create and edit scripts and flows locally, you can directly go to the [Develop Locally](#develop-locally) section.

For a more complex setup involving Git, you can go to the [Local development Recommended Setup](#local-development-recommended-setup).
