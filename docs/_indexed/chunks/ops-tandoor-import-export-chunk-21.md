## Rezeptsuite.de

Rezeptsuite.de exports are `.xml` files which can simply be uploaded to tandoor to import all your recipes.

It appears that Reptsuite, depending on the client, might export a `.zip` file containing a `.cml` file.
If this happens just unzip the zip file and change `.cml` to `.xml` to import your recipes.
