# Kafka triggers

> **Context**: Windmill can connect to [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) brokers servers and trigger runnables (scripts, flows) when a message is received. Listenin

Windmill can connect to [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) brokers servers and trigger runnables (scripts, flows) when a message is received.
Listening is done from the servers, so it doesn't take up any workers.
Kafka triggers is a [self-hosted Enterprise](/pricing) feature.
