## Melarecipes

Melarecipes provides multiple export formats but only the `MelaRecipes` format can export the complete collection.
Perform this export and open the `.melarecipes` file using your favorite archive opening program (e.g 7zip).
Repeat this if the file contains another `.melarecipes` file until you get a list of one or many `.melarecipe` files.
Upload all `.melarecipe` files you want to import to tandoor and start the import.
