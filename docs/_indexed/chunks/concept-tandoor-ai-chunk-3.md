## Configure AI Providers
When AI support is enabled for a space every user in a space can configure AI providers. 
The models shown in the editor have been tested and work with Tandoor. Most other models that can parse images/files and return text should also work. 

Superusers also have the ability to configure global AI providers that every space can use.
