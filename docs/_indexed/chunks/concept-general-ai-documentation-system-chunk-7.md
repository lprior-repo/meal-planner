## Building Documentation

When adding docs, optimize for **both humans and AI agents**:

1. **Write clearly**: Short, concrete, linked
2. **Structure for scanning**: Headings, tables, code blocks
3. **Cross-reference**: Link to 2-3 related docs
4. **Stay focused**: One topic per doc, under 1500 words
5. **Be complete**: Full answer in one place

This helps:
- **Humans**: Quickly find what they need, follow links to related topics
- **AI agents**: Navigate by following doc links, understand context through links
