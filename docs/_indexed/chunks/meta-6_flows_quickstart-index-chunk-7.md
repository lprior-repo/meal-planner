## Flow as Code

Flows are not the only way to write distributed programs that execute distinct jobs. Another approach is to write a program that defines the jobs and their dependencies, and then execute that program within a [Python](./meta-2_python_quickstart-index.md) or [TypeScript](./meta-1_typescript_quickstart-index.md) script. This is known as workflows as code.
