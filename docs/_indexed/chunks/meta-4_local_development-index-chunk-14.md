## LLMs rules for local development

The `wmill init` command will create cursor rules and CLAUDE.md files to enhance your AI experience when working with scripts and flows. These files provide context and guidelines for AI assistants to better assist you in creating scripts and flows that match Windmill's guidelines. You can safely delete them if you do not use LLMs on your local development.
