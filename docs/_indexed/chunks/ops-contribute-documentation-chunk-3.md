## With an IDE

You can fork the develop repository and edit the markdown files from your favorite IDE such as VSCode or PyCharm.
One advantage of using as IDE is that you can preview your changes by:

### Installing mkdocs

Now install mkdocs and dependencies: `pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin`.

### Serving Documetation

If you want to test the documentation, locally run `mkdocs serve` from the project root.
