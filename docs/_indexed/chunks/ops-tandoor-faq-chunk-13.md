## Why cant I get support for my manual setup?
Even tough I would love to help everyone get tandoor up and running I have only so much time
that I can spend on this project besides work, family and other life things.
Due to the countless problems that can occur when manually installing I simply do not have
the time to help solving each one.

You can install Tandoor manually but please do not expect me or anyone to help you with that. 
As a general advice: If you do it manually do NOT change anything at first and slowly work yourself 
to your dream setup.
