## Flow actions

An action script is simply a script that is neither a [trigger](./concept-windmill-10-flow-trigger.md) nor an [approval](./tutorial-windmill-11-flow-approval.md)
script. Those are the majority of the scripts.

There are two ways to create an action script:

- Write it directly in the flow editor.
- Import it from the Hub.
- Import it from the workspace.
