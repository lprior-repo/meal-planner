## What are spaces?
Spaces are is a type of feature used to separate one installation of Tandoor into several parts.
In technical terms it is a multi-tenant system.

You can compare a space to something like google drive or dropbox.
There is only one installation of the Dropbox system, but it handles multiple users without them noticing each other.
For Tandoor that means all people that work together on one recipe collection can be in one space.
If you want to host the collection of your friends, family, or neighbor you can create a separate space for them (through the admin interface).

Sharing between spaces is currently not possible but is planned for future releases.
