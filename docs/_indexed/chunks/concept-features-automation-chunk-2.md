## Unit, Food, Keyword Alias

Foods, Units and Keywords can have automations that automatically replace them with another object
to allow aliasing them.

This helps to add consistency to the naming of objects, for example to always use the singular form
for the main name if a plural form is configured.

These automations are best created by dragging and dropping Foods, Units or Keywords in their respective
views and creating the automation there.

You can also create them manually by setting the following

-   **Parameter 1**: name of food/unit/keyword to match
-   **Parameter 2**: name of food/unit/keyword to replace matched food with

These rules are processed whenever you are importing recipes from websites or other apps
and when using the simple ingredient input (shopping, recipe editor, ...).
