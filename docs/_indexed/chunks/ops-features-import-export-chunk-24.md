## Gourmet

An importer for files from [Gourmet](https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet/). As the `.grmt` files appears to lack the unit for ingredients
a file with `.zip` file with `.htm` and `.jpg`is expected.

To generate the file export to 'html' in Gourmet and zip the folder generated.

The import of menues is not supported

Export is not supported due to problems with `.grmt` format.
