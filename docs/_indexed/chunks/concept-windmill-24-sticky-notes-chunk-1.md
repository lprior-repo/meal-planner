# Sticky notes

> **Context**: import DocCard from '@site/src/components/DocCard';

Sticky notes allow you to annotate flows with documentation, comments, and organizational information directly on the flow canvas. Notes help document workflow logic, add TODOs, or explain complex sections to team members.

There are two types of sticky notes:

- **Free notes**: Can be placed anywhere on the canvas for general comments or documentation
- **Group notes**: Attached to a selection of nodes to document specific workflow sections
