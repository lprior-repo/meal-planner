## Executive Summary

The `food.categories.get.v2` endpoint returns a static list of food category metadata. After analyzing current use cases, this endpoint provides **limited value** for our meal planning workflow. The categories are primarily useful for building UI category browsers, which is not a current requirement.

**Recommendation:** **DEFER** implementation until a specific need emerges (e.g., category-based food filtering in UI).
