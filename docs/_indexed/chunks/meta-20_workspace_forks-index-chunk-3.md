## Example feature development workflow

1. **Create fork**: Fork the main workspace for new feature development
2. **Develop**: Make changes in the forked workspace
3. **Create PR**: Use github/gitlab to create a pull request
4. **Review & merge**: Team reviews changes before merging to main branch
5. **Sync back changes**: Changes are automatically synced to the workspace linked to the main branch
