## Supermarket Ordering

!!! warning "WIP"
    This feature is relatively new and I did not have the time to completely polished it yet, that said 
    it already works quite well.

You can create Supermarket Categories and Supermarkets in the admin interface.
After setting this up you can choose a supermarket for each shopping list.
This will automatically show the categories configured for this supermarket in the order specified.
All Foods that are not yet categorized can be dragged into their category, this will save the categories
for the future.
