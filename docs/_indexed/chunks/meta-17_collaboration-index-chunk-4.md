## Dev/Staging/Prod workspaces

Workspaces in Windmill enable a dev/staging/prod workflow directly from the web interface. You can create separate workspaces for different stages of development, such as development, staging, and production. This allows for easy deployment of changes from one workspace to another. Workspaces provide logical isolation and enable a structured approach to managing different environments.
