## Develop faster

Focus on code that matters: your critical business logic, from data transformation to internal API calls, starts as scripts and SQL files. Windmill transforms these into scalable microservices and tools without the usual heavy lifting.

Boilerplate code is eliminated as Windmill takes care of the repetitive work of building UIs, [handling errors](./meta-10_error_handling-index.md), scaling logic, and [managing dependencies](./meta-6_imports-index.md), making these aspects more streamlined.
