## Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, in-memory key-value store that can be used for caching, message brokering, and real-time analytics. It supports a variety of data structures such as strings, lists, sets, and hashes, providing flexibility for non-structured data storage and management. Redis is known for its high performance and low-latency data access, making it a suitable choice for applications requiring fast data retrieval and processing.

To use Redis with Windmill:

1. [Sign-up to Redis](https://redis.com/try-free/).

2. [Create a database](https://developer.redis.com/create).

3. [Integrate it to Windmill](../../integrations/redis.md) by filling the [resource type details](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/22/) following the same schema as MongoDB Atlas.
