## How workspace forks work

Workspace forks create a complete copy of your workspace, including scripts, flows, apps, resources, and variables. Each fork operates independently and changes can later be merged to a parent workspace through a couple of methods.

Key features:
- **Independent development**: Make changes without affecting the parent workspace
- **Git integration**: Automatically creates corresponding git branches using the git sync workflow
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on separate forks simultaneously
