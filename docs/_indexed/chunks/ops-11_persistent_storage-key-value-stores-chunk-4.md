1. [Sign-up to Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/).

2. [Create a database](https://docs.upstash.com/redis).

3. [Integrate it to Windmill](../../integrations/upstash.md) by filling the [resource type details](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/22/) following the same schema as MongoDB Atlas.
