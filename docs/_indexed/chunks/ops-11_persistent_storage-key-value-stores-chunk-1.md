This page is part of our section on [Persistent storage & databases](./meta-11_persistent_storage-index.md) which covers where to effectively store and manage the data manipulated by Windmill. Check that page for more options on data storage.

Key-value stores are a popular choice for managing non-structured data, providing a flexible and scalable solution for various data types and use cases. In the context of Windmill, you can use MongoDB Atlas, Redis, and Upstash to store and manipulate non-structured data effectively.
