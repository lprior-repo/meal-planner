!!! danger "WIP"
    This application was developed for private use in a trusted environment.
    Due to popular demand a basic permission system has been added. 
    It does its job protecting the most critical parts of the application, but it is **not yet recommended** to 
    give accounts to completely untrusted users.
    Work is done to improve the permission system, but it's not yet fully done and tested.
