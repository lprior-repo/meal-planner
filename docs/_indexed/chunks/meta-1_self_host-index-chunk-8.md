## First time login

Once you have setup your environment for deployment and have access to the instance, you will be able to login with the default credentials `admin@windmill.dev` / `changeme` (even if you [setup OAuth](../../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx)).

Then you will be redirected to the [Instance settings](./meta-18_instance_settings-index.md) page. You can always change the settings later.

Then you can set up a new account that will override the default [superadmin](./meta-16_roles_and_permissions-index.md#superadmin) account. This is also where you can setup Hub Sync to use on your workspace [Resource types](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md) from [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/) ((by default, everyday)).

At last, you will get to create a new workspace.
