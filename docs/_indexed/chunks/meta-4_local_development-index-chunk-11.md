## push your changes to the Windmill workspace
wmill sync push
```

Once the workspace folder is pulled, edits can be made using any IDE (including the [VS Code extension](./meta-1_vscode-extension-index.md)).

When created and edited through the UI (Windmill App), the lockfile is automatically generated. On local development, each script gets:
- a content file (`script_path.py`, `script_path.ts`, `script_path.go`, etc.) that contains the code of the script,
- a metadata file (`script_path.yaml`) that contains the metadata of the script,
- a lockfile (`script_path.lock`) that contains the dependencies of the script.

You can get those 3 files for each script by pulling your workspace with command [`wmill sync pull`](./ops-3_cli-sync.md).

Editing a script is as simple as editing its content. The code can be edited freely in your IDE, and there are possibilities to even run it locally if you have the correct development environment setup for the script language.

### Metadata file and lockfile

Some fields of the metadata file can also be edited by hand, like the summary of the description fields. If you update the dependencies of your script, or the signature of the `main` method, the lockfile and/or the script schema will need to be updated. We do not recommend doing it by hand.

[Windmill CLI](./meta-3_cli-index.md) comes with a [`wmill script generate-metadata`](./concept-3_cli-script.md#re-generating-a-script-metadata-file) command that will read all the files that have been edited and gracefully update the metadata file and lockfile accordingly.
This command is mainly used update the lockfile and schema inplace. Be re-assured, any manual update to other files like summary and description will be kept:

_Generate metadata command:_

![Generate Metadata](./generate_metadata.png 'Generate Metadata')

_And the modified files:_

![Modified Files](./modified_files.png 'Modified Files')

Note that you can explicitly exclude (or include) specific files or folders to be taken into account by this command, with a [`wmill.yaml` file](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-sync-example/blob/main/wmill.yaml).

You can also generate metadata for a single script with `wmill script generate-metadata <path>`.

The lockfile is not meant to be edited manually. It is generated by Windmill when the script is created or edited through the UI and updated locally with the `wmill script generate-metadata` command. However, it is useful to check [versions](./meta-6_imports-index.md) changes.

For each language, there is a way to [pin the version directly within script](./meta-14_dependencies_in_typescript-index.md#lockfile-per-script-inferred-from-imports-standard). This is the recommended way of managing dependencies.
Locally, the lockfile is respected. It "wins" over the dependencies pinned via the script. Hence the need of the `generate-metadata` command to update the lockfile and metadata files.

Locally, flows and apps are stored in a folder ending with `.flow` and `.app` respectively. They include a `flow.yaml` and `app.yaml` file respectively, and the 3 files mentioned [above](#editing-and-creating-scripts-locally) for each inline script they contain.

### Package.json & requirements.txt

If you have a `package.json` or `requirements.txt` file in the same or parent directory as your script, the `wmill script generate-metadata` command will automatically include the dependencies in the metadata file.

The lockfile for a file generated with generated-metadata will be overriden by the closest package.json from a parent or current folder if there is one.

![Generate Metadata Path](./generate_metadata_path.png 'Generate Metadata Path')

But what if you want to create a new script from scratch? It's also easy, just create a file with the correct extension (or run `wmill script bootstrap <path> <language>`), and simply run `generate-metadata` command to generate the metadata file. The name of the file and its location in the folder will become the script path in Windmill.

  <summary>File extension per script language</summary>

| Nu                  | `.nu`                       |

Similar for flow, you can manually create a folder ending with `.flow` and containing a `flow.yaml` file.

<details>
  <summary>`flow.yaml` initial content</summary>

```yaml
summary: ''
description: ''
value:
  modules: []
schema:
  $schema: 'https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema'
  type: object
  order: []
  properties: {}
  required: []
ws_error_handler_muted: false
```

More info [here](./meta-13_json_schema_and_parsing-index.md).

</details>

Flows can be more difficult to edit at the beginning because ones need to be familiar with the OpenFlow definitions to be able to write the YAML file. To help you with that, you can use our [VS Code extension](./meta-1_vscode-extension-index.md).

:::tip CLI Bootstrap

Windmill CLI also has a `bootstrap` command (both for `wmill script` and `wmill flow`) which can be used to create a new script in the desired language or flow. All files will be automatically created and the script content will be a simply "Hello world" in the desired language, which can then be updated.

:::

Lastly, it is possible to execute scripts locally and even plug them to any unit testing framework. More info on the [Run locally documentation page](./ops-4_local_development-run-locally.md).

### VS Code extension

The Windmill VS Code extension allows you to build scripts and flows in the comfort of your VS Code editor, while leveraging Windmill UIs for test & flows edition.
