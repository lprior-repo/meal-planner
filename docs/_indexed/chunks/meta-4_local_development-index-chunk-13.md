## Deploy from GitHub/GitLab with Staging/Prod

Syncing directly from the CLI is great, but instead of using the CLI directly, you should combine it with your CI/CD and set up a full productive Git workflow with a Staging and Prod workspaces and [Git sync](./meta-11_git_sync-index.md). See more details here:
