## Keep control of slept steps

The [Runs menu](./meta-windmill-index-76.md) provides a dashboard to monitor all past, current and future runs. While a flow is executed and paused, you can see in a single view:

- the current state of the flow
- the steps that were already executed
- the incoming ones
