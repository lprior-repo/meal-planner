!!! danger "Tandoor 2 Compatibility"
    This guide has not been verified/tested for Tandoor 2, which now integrates a nginx service inside the default docker container and exposes its service on port 80 instead of 8080.

These are instructions for pacman based distributions, like ArchLinux. The package is available from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tandoor-recipes-git) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/jdecourval/tandoor-recipes-pkgbuild).
