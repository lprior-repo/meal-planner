## Default Configuration
By default the AI features are enabled for every space. Each space has a spending limit of roughly 1 USD per month.
This can be changed using the [configuration variables](https://docs.tandoor.dev/system/configuration/#ai-integration)

You can change these settings any time using the django admin. If you do not care about AI cost you can enter a very high limit or disable cost tracking for your providers.
The limit resets on the first of every month.
