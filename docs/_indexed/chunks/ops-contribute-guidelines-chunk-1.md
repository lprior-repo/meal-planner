!!! danger "Discuss First!"
     If you want to contribute larger features that introduce more complexity to the project please
     make sure to **first submit a technical description** outlining what and how you want to do it.
     This allows me and the community to give feedback and manage the complexity of the overall
     application. If you don't do this please don't be mad if I reject your PR.
