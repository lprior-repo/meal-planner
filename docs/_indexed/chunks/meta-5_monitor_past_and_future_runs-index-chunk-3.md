## Details per run

Clicking on each run in the menu opens a run page where you can view the run's state, inputs, and success/failure reasons.

![Details per run](./2-detail-per-run.png 'Details per run')

> View of a past run.

<br />

You can also view [scheduled](./meta-1_scheduling-index.md) runs from the run menu, which provides information on the arguments used and the next trigger.

View of a scheduled run:

> Although scheduled scripts and flows are visible on their [dedicated tab](./meta-1_scheduling-index.md), the run menu helps you see the next scheduled one.
