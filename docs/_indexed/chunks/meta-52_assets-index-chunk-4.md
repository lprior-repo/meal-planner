## Asset nodes in flows

In flows, your assets will show up as asset nodes, making data flow easy to visualize :

![Asset nodes](./asset_nodes.png 'Asset nodes')

The Read/Write mode is used to show the asset as an input or output node.

When running a flow and passing an asset as an input, it will appear as an input of the flow in the preview graph :
