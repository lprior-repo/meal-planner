## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps that can be useful in a real-world use case:

- Pass [variables and secrets](./meta-2_variables_and_secrets-index.md)
  to a script.
- Connect to [resources](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md).
- [Trigger that script](./meta-8_triggers-index.md) in many ways.
- Compose scripts in [Flows](./tutorial-flows-1-flow-editor.md) or [Apps](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).
- You can [share your scripts](../../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md) with the community on [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev). Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.

Scripts are immutable and there is an hash for each deployment of a given script. Scripts are never overwritten and referring to a script by path is referring to the latest deployed hash at that path.

	/>
</div>

For each script, a UI is autogenerated from the jsonchema inferred from the script signature, and can be customized further as standalone or embedded into rich UIs using the [App builder](./meta-7_apps_quickstart-index.md).

		description="main function's arguments can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."

	/>
</div>

In addition to the UI, sync and async [webhooks](./meta-4_webhooks-index.md) are generated for each deployment.
