[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) is built on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), a UI framework that uses a compiler to let you write breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser, using languages you already know — HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's a love letter to web development.

```
cd apps && npm create svelte@latest <project>
```

You will be prompted to choose between select templates, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Playwright and Vitest among other options. moon supports and has guides for many of these tools.

> We highly suggest reading our documentation on [using Vite (and Vitest) with moon](/docs/guides/examples/vite), [using ESLint with moon](/docs/guides/examples/eslint) and [using Prettier with moon](/docs/guides/examples/prettier) for a more holistic view.
