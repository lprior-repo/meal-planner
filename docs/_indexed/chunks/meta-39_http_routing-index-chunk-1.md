Windmill supports HTTP Routes as triggers to execute runnables (scripts or flows) whenever the route is hit by an external HTTP request, and it can also serve static files or websites.

This feature is ideal for integrating with third-party services, custom webhooks, or internal systems where events are sent via HTTP.
