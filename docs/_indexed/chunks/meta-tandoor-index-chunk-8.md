## About
This application has originally been developed to index, tag and search my collection of digital (PDF) recipes.
Over the time tons of features have been added making this the most comprehensive recipe management system. 

I am just a single developer with many other interests and obligations so development and support might be slow at times, 
but I try my best to constantly improve this application.

If you have any wishes, feature requests, problems or ideas feel free to open an issue on GitHub.
