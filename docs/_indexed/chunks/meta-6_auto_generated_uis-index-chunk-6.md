## Types

Each [type](./meta-13_json_schema_and_parsing-index.md#script-parameters-to-json-schema) in Windmill has its own UI representation.

You can also check [special types](./meta-13_json_schema_and_parsing-index.md#special-types) that are types that are made by Windmill and have a particular behavior in the UI.
