## JSON Schema specification

A JSON Schema defines the properties, types, and constraints of a JSON object. It consists of the following components:

- `$schema`: The URL that points to the JSON Schema specification.
- `type`: The type of the JSON object (e.g., object, string, number).
- `properties`: A dictionary that defines the properties of the JSON object along with their descriptions and types.
- `required`: A list of the mandatory properties.
- Additional features and constraints can be added to the JSON Schema, such as validation against regular expressions or other custom formats.
