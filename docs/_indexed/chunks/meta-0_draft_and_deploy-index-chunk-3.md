## Draft

Local edits can be saved as a draft for staging purposes. A draft is visible from members of the workspace and can be edited. There is only one draft per runnable. The draft inherits the permission of the item it is attached to or at the path they are in for drafts non deployed items.

Drafts can be run and tested only from the editor (script, flow or app) with the `Test` button.
