## You already have your own database

If you already have your own database provided by a supported integration, you can easily connect it to Windmill.

If your service provider is already part of [our list of integrations](../../integrations/0_integrations_on_windmill.mdx), just add your database as a [resource](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md).

If your service provider is not already integrated with Windmill, you can create a [new resource type](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md#create-a-resource-type) to establish the connection (and if you want, [share the schema on our Hub](../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md)).
