## Shareable page

A static page is created for each potential deployment to Staging/Prod.

This can be useful for non-admin (for example, operators) to share a page to properly-permissioned users to have them review or do the deployment.

![Shareable link](./shareable_link.png.webp 'Shareable link')

> Even users who are not admin can see the "Deploy to staging/prod", from where they can get the link of the shareable page.

<br/>

![Shareable page](./shareable_page.png.webp 'Shareable page')

> This page then allows users with the right permissions to deploy the given items.
