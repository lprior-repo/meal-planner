# VCS hooks

> **Context**: VCS hooks (most popular with [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)) are a mechanism for running scripts at pre-defined phase

v1.9.0

VCS hooks (most popular with [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)) are a mechanism for running scripts at pre-defined phases in the VCS's lifecycle, most commonly pre-commit, pre-push, or pre-merge. With moon, we provide a built-in solution for managing hooks, and syncing them across developers and machines.
