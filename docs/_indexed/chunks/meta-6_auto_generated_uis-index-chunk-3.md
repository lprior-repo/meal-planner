## AI form filling

Windmill can automatically fill your script and flow input forms using AI to save you time and effort.

You can enable that feature from your script or flow settings. You can also provide custom instructions to guide the AI on how to fill the form, making it adapt to your specific workflow needs.

This feature is powered by [Windmill AI](./meta-22_ai_generation-index.md), which provides comprehensive AI assistance throughout the platform.
