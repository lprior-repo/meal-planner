## Triggers from external events

### Webhooks

In Windmill, webhooks are autogenerated for each Script and Flow, providing either asynchronous or synchronous execution modes. You can use preprocessors to transform the incoming webhook payload before it reaches your script or flow.

These webhooks accept incoming HTTP requests, allowing users to easily trigger their Windmill scripts and flows from external services by simply sending a POST request to the appropriate authentified webhook URL (requires passing a [token](./meta-4_webhooks-index.md#webhook-specific-tokens) as Bearer or query arg). Their purpose is to have the script run when it receives an input from its associated webhook.

Using webhooks, you could also trigger a script from other scripts.

#### Webhooks: trigger scripts from Slack

One use case of webhooks is [building a Slackbot with Windmill](/blog/handler-slack-commands).

	controls
	src="/videos/generated_email.mp4"
/>

<br />

Windmill uses Slack to trigger scripts and flows by establishing Slackbots and creating specific commands. By connecting Slack with Windmill, parsing incoming Slack commands, and leveraging Windmill workflows, operational teams can trigger complex automations directly from Slack.

	/>
</div>

### Emails

Scripts and flows can be triggered by email messages sent to a specific email address, leveraging [SMTP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-smtp/). Preprocessors can be used to parse and transform the email content before it's processed by your script or flow.

		href="/docs/advanced/email_triggers"
	/>
</div>

### Custom HTTP routes

Windmill allows you to define custom HTTP routes for your scripts and flows. You can use preprocessors to transform incoming HTTP requests, handling headers, query parameters, and path parameters before they reach your script or flow.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		title="Custom HTTP routes"
		description="Custom HTTP routes for your scripts and flows."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/http_routing"
	/>
</div>

### WebSocket triggers

Windmill can connect to WebSocket servers and trigger runnables (scripts, flows) when a message is received. Preprocessors can transform the websocket message data before it's passed to your script or flow.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="WebSocket triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from WebSocket servers."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/websocket_triggers"
	/>
</div>

### Postgres triggers

Windmill can connect to a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and trigger runnables (scripts, flows) in response to database transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on specified tables, schemas, or the entire database.  

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Postgres triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from postgres database servers."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/postgres_triggers"
	/>
</div>

### Kafka triggers

Windmill can connect to Kafka brokers and trigger scripts or flows when messages are received on specific topics. This enables real-time processing of events from your Kafka ecosystem. Preprocessors can transform the Kafka message data before it reaches your script or flow.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Kafka triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from Kafka messages."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/kafka_triggers"
	/>
</div>

### NATS triggers

Windmill can connect to NATS servers and trigger scripts or flows when messages are received on specific subjects. This enables real-time processing of events from your NATS ecosystem. Preprocessors can transform the NATS message data before it reaches your script or flow.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="NATS triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from NATS messages."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/nats_triggers"
	/>
</div>

### SQS triggers

Windmill can connect to an Amazon SQS queues and trigger scripts or flows when messages are received. This enables event-driven processing from your AWS ecosystem. Preprocessors can transform the SQS message data before it reaches your script or flow.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="SQS triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from Amazon SQS messages."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/sqs_triggers"
	/>
</div>

### MQTT triggers

Windmill can connect to an MQTT broker, subscribe to specific topics, and trigger scripts or flows when messages are received, enabling event-driven processing. Preprocessors can transform the MQTT message data before it reaches your script or flow.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="MQTT triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from MQTT broker."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/mqtt_triggers"
	/>
</div>

### GCP triggers

Windmill can connect to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, subscribe to specific topics, and trigger scripts or flows when messages are published, enabling event-driven processing. Preprocessors can transform the Pub/Sub message data before it reaches your script or flow.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
  <DocCard
    title="GCP Pub/Sub triggers"
    description="Trigger scripts and flows from Google Cloud Pub/Sub."
    href="/docs/core_concepts/gcp_triggers"
  />
</div>


### Scheduled polls (Scheduling + Trigger scripts)

A particular use case for schedules are [Trigger scripts](./concept-flows-10-flow-trigger.md).

Trigger scripts are used in [Flows](./tutorial-flows-1-flow-editor.md) and are designed to pull data from an external source and return all of the new items since the last run, without resorting to external webhooks. A trigger script is intended to be used as scheduled poll with [schedules](./meta-1_scheduling-index.md) and [states](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md#states) (rich objects in JSON, persistent from one run to another) in order to compare the execution to the previous one and process each new item in a [for loop](./tutorial-flows-12-flow-loops.md). If there are no new items, the flow will be skipped.

You could set your script in a flow after a Trigger script to have it run only when new data is available.
