## Users

Users are uniquely identified globally by their email. They also have a unique username with respect to each workspace they are members of.

In terms of billing for Windmill [Enterprise Edition](/pricing), we only count active users, i.e. users who have at least logged in to the platform in the last 30 days according to the audit logs. [Operators](#operator) (i.e. users who are Operators in all workspaces they are members of) are counted as half of a regular seat. Logging in once in 30 days is enough to be considered 'Active'.
