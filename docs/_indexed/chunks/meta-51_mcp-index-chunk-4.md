## Troubleshooting

- **Not seeing any scripts/flows?**
  - Ensure your LLM tool is connected to the correct MCP URL.
  - If you chose the "favorites only" option when creating your MCP URL, make sure the script or flow is in your favorites.
- **My LLM does not find the correct script/flow to run**
  - Ensure the script or flow is deployed and visible in your workspace.
  - Choose good titles and descriptions to help the LLM find the correct script/flow.
- **Client has issues connecting to the MCP server**
  - Make sure your MCP client is configured to use **HTTP streamable** as the transport protocol.
  - Verify that your MCP URL is correct and the token is valid.
