# Getting started with Windmill

> **Context**: import DocCard from '@site/src/components/DocCard';

Windmill is a fast, **<a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill">open-source</a>** workflow engine and developer platform. It's an alternative to the likes of Retool, Superblocks, n8n, Airflow, Prefect, Kestra and Temporal, designed to **build comprehensive internal tools** (endpoints, workflows, UIs). It supports coding in TypeScript, Python, Go, PHP, Bash, C#, SQL and Rust, or any Docker image, alongside intuitive low-code builders.
