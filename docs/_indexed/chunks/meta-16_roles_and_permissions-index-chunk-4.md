## Roles in Windmill

Users can be given different levels of permissions:

### Superadmin

The superadmin role has the highest level of access and can manage the entire Windmill instance. Only superadmins can access the dedicated 'admins' workspace. Also by default, superadmins have access to all workspaces as admins of those workspaces. When an admin does an action as a user of a workspace he is not a member of and as such as no username in, their email is used in lieu of the username. Windmill can be configured to remove the ability for non-superadmins to create workspace using the: CREATE_WORKSPACE_REQUIRE_SUPERADMIN env variable.

### Devops

The devops role is also set at the instance level. Conceptually, it can be understood as a "readonly Superadmin". Devops users have read rights over what is usually only visible to [superadmins](#superadmin), such as [Service Logs](./meta-36_service_logs-index.md) or [Critical Alerts](./meta-37_critical_alerts-index.md) while keeping write operations to a minimum. Contrary to the superadmin, this role does not supersede other roles like [workspace admins](#admin).

### Admin

At the [workspace](#workspace) level, admins have the ability to manage a specific Windmill workspace and users within that workspace. They can see and edit all scripts, flows, apps, and other entities within the workspace. Admins have the power to create, modify, and delete entities and can manage permissions within the workspace.

At the [folder](./meta-8_groups_and_folders-index.md#folders) level, an admin of a folder has read, write and archive access to all the elements inside the folders ([scripts](./meta-0_scripts_quickstart-index.md), [flows](./meta-6_flows_quickstart-index.md), [apps](./meta-7_apps_quickstart-index.md), [resources](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md), [schedules](./meta-1_scheduling-index.md)) and can manage the permissions as well as add new admins.

### Developer

Developers can execute and view scripts, flows, and apps within a workspace. Developers see the full interface of Windmill and contrary to the Operators, they have the ability to create and edit scripts, flows and apps. Developers have read and write access to the entities they create or have been [granted access to by others](./meta-8_groups_and_folders-index.md).

### Operator

Operators have limited access within a workspace. They can only execute and view scripts, flows, and apps that they have visibility on, and only those that are within their allowed path or [folders](./meta-8_groups_and_folders-index.md). Operators do not have the ability to create or modify entities.
The recommended way to share scripts and flows with operators is through [auto-generated apps](./meta-6_auto_generated_uis-index.md).
With the second option being of sharing the script and [variables](./meta-2_variables_and_secrets-index.md) it depends on (but operators won't be able to load variable directly from the UI/API, only use them within the scripts they have access to).

From the workspace settings, you can configure the operator visibility settings for your workspace. In particular, you can allow/disallow operators to view:

- [Runs](./meta-5_monitor_past_and_future_runs-index.md)
- [Schedules](./meta-1_scheduling-index.md)
- [Resources](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md)
- [Variables](./meta-2_variables_and_secrets-index.md)
- [Triggers](./meta-8_triggers-index.md)
- [Audit logs](./meta-14_audit_logs-index.md)
- [Groups](./meta-8_groups_and_folders-index.md#groups)
- [Folders](./meta-8_groups_and_folders-index.md#folders)
- [Workers](./meta-9_worker_groups-index.md)

Regarding to [Pricing](/pricing), operators are counted as half of a regular seat ([developers](#developer)) as long as they are operators in all workspaces they are members of. Operators are not set as the instance-level. On the billing side, 1 developer seat or 2 operators seats count as 1 seat, there is no need to differentiate between developers and operators when purchasing the license.

### Anonymous app viewers

Anonymous app viewers are individuals who can access and view Windmill apps without being a user but by knowing the [secret URL](../../apps/0_toolbar.mdx#deploy) that allows app viewing. They do not have any editing or privileges to execute scripts and flows. The apps that they see execute the scripts and flows that are part of the app but only on behalf of the app author. The anonymous user cannot execute any of the scripts and flows part of the apps outside of the inputs authorized by the app through a policy that is automatically generated by the app.
