One of moon's most powerful features is the toolchain, which automatically manages, downloads, and installs Node.js and other languages behind the scenes using proto. It also enables advanced functionality for task running based on the platform (language and environment combination) it runs in.

The toolchain is configured with `.moon/toolchain.yml`.
