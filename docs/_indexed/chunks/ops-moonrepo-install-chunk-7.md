## Nightly releases

moon supports nightly releases, which are built and published once a day from the latest commit on master. When using a nightly release, you'll need to download and execute the binaries manually.

-   Using our npm package [`@moonrepo/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonrepo/cli?activeTab=versions) under the `nightly` tag. Releases are versioned by date.
-   From a [GitHub prerelease](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/nightly) using the `nightly` tag. This tag always represents the latest stable release.
