## Adding External Recipes

To add a new path from your Storage backend to the sync list, go to `username >> External Recipes` and
select the storage backend you want to use.
Then enter the path you want to monitor starting at the storage root (e.g. `/Folder/RecipesFolder`, or `/opt/recipes/externalfiles' in the docker example above) and save it.
