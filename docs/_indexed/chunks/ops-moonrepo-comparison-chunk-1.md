The following comparisons are *not* an exhaustive list of features, and may be inaccurate or out of date, but represent a good starting point for investigation. If something is not correct, please create an issue or submit a patch.

> Looking to migrate from Nx or Turborepo to moon? Use our `moon ext migrate-nx` or `moon ext migrate-turborepo` commands for a (somewhat) seamless migration!
