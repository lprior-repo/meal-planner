## Concurrency limit of scripts within flow

The Concurrency limit operates globally and across flow runs. It involves two key parameters: "Maximum number of runs" and the "Per time window (seconds)."

Concurrency limit can be set for each step of a flow in the `Advanced` menu, on tab "Concurrency".
