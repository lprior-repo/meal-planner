## Pepperplate

Pepperplate provides a `.zip` file containing all of your recipes as `.txt` files. These files are well-structured and allow
the import of all data without losing anything.

Simply export the recipes from Pepperplate and upload the zip to Tandoor. Images are not included in the export and
thus cannot be imported.
