## Creating User accounts

!!! warning
    Users without groups cannot do anything. Make sure to assign them a group!

You can either create new users through the admin interface or by sending them invite links.

Invite links can be generated on the System page. If you specify a username during the creation of the link 
the person using it won't be able to change that name.
