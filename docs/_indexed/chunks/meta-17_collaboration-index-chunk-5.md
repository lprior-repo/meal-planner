## Multiplayer editing

Multiplayer editing is available for script editing in the Cloud & Enterprise Self-Hosted of Windmill. It allows simultaneous collaboration and displays a presence bar to avoid conflicts. Windmill is actively working on adding multiplayer editing for flow and app editors as well. This feature enhances real-time collaboration among team members.
