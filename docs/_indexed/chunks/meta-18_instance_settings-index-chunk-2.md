## Admins workspace

The Admins workspace is for [superadmins](./meta-16_roles_and_permissions-index.md#superadmin) only and contains scripts whose purpose is to manage your Windmill instance, such as [keeping resource types up to date](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md#sync-resource-types-with-windmillhub) or the New User Setup App.

The [resources types](./meta-3_resources_and_types-index.md) created from the Admins workspace are shared across all workspaces.

You can access it from the list of workspaces or from Instance settings.
