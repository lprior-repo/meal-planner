## Repository operations

Each configured repository supports several operations:

- **Test connection**: Verify repository access and credentials
- **Preview changes**: Perform a dry-run to see what would be synced
- **Push to repository**: Send workspace content to git repository
- **Pull from repository**: Get changes from git repository to workspace
- **Pull settings**: Get only wmill.yaml configuration changes
- **Initialize repository**: Set up new git repository with Windmill structure
