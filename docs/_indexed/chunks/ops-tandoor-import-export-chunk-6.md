## Mealie

Mealie provides structured data similar to nextcloud.

!!! WARNING "Versions"
    There are two different versions of the Mealie importer. One for all backups created prior to Version 1.0 and one for all after. 

!!! INFO "Versions"
    The Mealie UI does not indicate weather or not nutrition information is stored per serving or per recipe. This choice is left to the user. During the import you will have to choose 
    how Tandoor should treat your nutrition data.

To migrate your recipes

1. Go to your Mealie admin settings and create a new backup.
2. Download the backup.
3. Upload the entire `.zip` file to the importer page and import everything.
