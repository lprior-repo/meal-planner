## Granular permissions

Windmill employs a granular permission system along with folder and group permissions. Users can be assigned to groups, and folders can be granted read/write access to groups or individual users. This system enables fine-grained control over who can access and modify specific items. Items can also be selectively shared with specific groups or users.
