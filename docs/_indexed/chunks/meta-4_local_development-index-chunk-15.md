## Run locally

Windmill has its [own integrated development environment](../../code_editor/index.mdx). But for iteration, integration with CI/CD and testing purposes you may need to run a script locally that also interacts with Windmill (for example, to retrieve resources). It will allow you to integrate Windmill with any testing framework.

To setup a local development environment for Windmill, see the dedicated Local development page (above).

To [run scripts locally](./ops-4_local_development-run-locally.md), you will need to fill out the context variables that would otherwise be filled out by the Windmill runtime for you.
