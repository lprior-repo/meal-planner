## Default

The default integration is the built in (and preferred) way to import and export recipes.
It is maintained with new fields added and contains all data to transfer your recipes from one installation to another.

It is also one of the few recipe formats that is actually structured in a way that allows for
easy machine readability if you want to use the data for any other purpose.
