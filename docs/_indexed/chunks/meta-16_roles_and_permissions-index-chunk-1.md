# Roles and permissions

> **Context**: import DocCard from '@site/src/components/DocCard';

Windmill provides a roles and permissions system that allows you to control access and manage permissions within your instance and workspaces. Different roles have different levels of access to scripts, flows, apps, and other entities in Windmill.

Everybody having access to a Windmill instance is considered a User.
