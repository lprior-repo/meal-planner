## Core features

**An efficient runtime**: execute code [across languages](./meta-windmill-index-96.md) with minimal overhead and instant starts.

**Smart dependency and input management**: automatically generate lockfiles and input specs from your code, ensuring consistent [dependency versions](./meta-windmill-index-17.md) and simplified [input handling](./meta-windmill-index-27.md).

**Dynamic web IDE and low-code builders**: create [scripts](./meta-windmill-index-101.md) with advanced editing tools and [auto-generated UIs](./meta-windmill-index-77.md), build [flows](./tutorial-windmill-1-flow-editor.md) with a drag-and-drop interface, and design [apps](./apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx) without extensive coding.

**Enterprise-ready**: Windmill offers robust [permissioning](./meta-windmill-index-30.md), [secret management](./meta-windmill-index-46.md), OAuth, and more, wrapped in an enterprise-grade platform.

**Integrations and automations**: with [webhooks](./meta-windmill-index-68.md), an [open API](https://app.windmill.dev/openapi.html), and a [scheduler](./meta-windmill-index-34.md), Windmill fits seamlessly into your infrastructure, allowing for extensive automation capabilities.

**Local development**: develop scripts and flows locally using your favorite IDE with the [VS Code extension](./meta-windmill-index-22.md) and [CLI](./meta-windmill-index-14.md), then sync with [Git integration](./meta-windmill-index-2.md) for version control and deployment workflows.
