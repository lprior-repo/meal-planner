## How can I create users?
To create a new user click on your name (top right corner) and select 'space settings'. Click create listed below invites.

It is not possible to create users through the admin because users must be assigned a default group and space.

To change a user's space you need to go to the admin and select User Infos.

If you use an external auth provider or proxy authentication make sure to specify a default group and space in the
environment configuration.
