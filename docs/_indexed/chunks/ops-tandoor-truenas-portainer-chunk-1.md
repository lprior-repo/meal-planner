!!! danger "Tandoor 2 Compatibility"
    This guide has not been verified/tested for Tandoor 2, which now integrates a nginx service inside the default docker container and exposes its service on port 80 instead of 8080.

This guide is to assist those installing Tandoor Recipes on Truenas Core using Docker and or Portainer

Docker install instructions adapted from [PhasedLogix IT Services's guide](https://getmethegeek.com/blog/2021-01-07-add-docker-capabilities-to-truenas-core/). Portainer install instructions adopted from the [Portainer Official Documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install-ce/server/docker/linux). Tandoor installation on Portainer provided by users `Szeraax` and `TransatlanticFoe` on Discord (Thank you two!)
