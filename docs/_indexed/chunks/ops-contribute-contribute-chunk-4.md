## Documentation

Helping improve the documentation for Tandoor is one of the easiest ways to give back and doesn't even require deep technical knowledge.
You can write guides on how to install and configure Tandoor expanding our repository of non-standard configuations.
Or you can write how-to guides using some of Tandoor's advanced features such as authentication or automation.

See [here](/contribute/documentation/) for more information on how to add documentation to Tandoor.
