Instance settings are accessible to all [superadmins](./meta-16_roles_and_permissions-index.md#superadmin) of your Windmill instance. This is where you manage settings and features across all workspaces. One instance can have several workspaces.

This is from the Instance settings that you can see on which Windmill [version](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/releases) your instance is running.
