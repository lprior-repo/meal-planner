## Test your flow

You don't have to explore all Flow editor possibilities at once. At each step, test what you're building to keep control on your wonder. You can also test up to a certain step by clicking on an action (x) and then on `Test up to x`.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard

		description="Iterate quickly and get control on your flow testing."

	/>
</div>

When you're done, [deploy](./meta-0_draft_and_deploy-index.md) your flow, schedule it, [create and app from it](./meta-6_auto_generated_uis-index.md), or even [publish it to Hub](../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md).

Follow our [detailed section](./tutorial-flows-1-flow-editor.md) on the Flow editor for more information.
