## Test flow

Test your current version of the flow with the `Test flow` button. This will opens a menu with an [auto-generated UI](./meta-6_auto_generated_uis-index.md) of your current configuration.

You can also test up to a certain step by clicking on an action (x) and then on `Test up to x`.

At last, you can directly [test a step](#test-this-step).
