!!! danger
    The version containing Templating is not yet released! This documentation is only to illustrate the pending changes
    facilitate the discussion.

With the Version `0.14.0` support for using a custom Jinja2 Template in recipe step instructions has been added.

This allows you to write ingredients with their corresponding amount directly inside the text while still profiting
from recipe scaling.
