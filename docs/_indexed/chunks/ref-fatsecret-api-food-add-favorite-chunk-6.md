## Usage Notes

- Use `foods.search` to find `food_id` values
- Optionally specify `serving_id` and `number_of_units` to set default serving preferences
- If the food is already a favorite, this call will update the serving preferences
- Favorites make it faster for users to log frequently eaten foods
