## Development options

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Windmill supports development directly within its [built-in IDE](../../code_editor/index.mdx), tailored for creating scripts, workflows, and UIs efficiently.

### Local development
Prefer your own setup? No problem. Windmill integrates smoothly with local environments, including a [VS Code extension](./meta-1_vscode-extension-index.md) and tools for [Git-based deployment to production](./meta-12_deploy_to_prod-index.md). [Explore local development options](./meta-4_local_development-index.md).
