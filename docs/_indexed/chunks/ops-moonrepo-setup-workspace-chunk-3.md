## Migrate from an existing build system

Looking to migrate from Nx or Turborepo to moon? Use our `moon ext migrate-nx` or `moon ext migrate-turborepo` commands for a (somewhat) seamless migration!

These extensions will convert your existing configuration files to moon's format as best as possible, but is not a requirement.
