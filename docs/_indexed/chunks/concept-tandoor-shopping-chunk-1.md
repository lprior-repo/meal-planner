!!! info "WIP"
    While being around for a while there are still a lot of features that I plan on adding to the shopping list.
    You can see an overview of what is still planned on [this](https://github.com/vabene1111/recipes/issues/114) issue.


Shopping lists allow you to easily convert a recipe or even a whole meal plan into a shopping list. From there
you can either use it on the site or export it to your shopping list of choice. 
It also includes automatic supermarket specific ordering.
