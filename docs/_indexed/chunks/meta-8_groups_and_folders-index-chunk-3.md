## Groups

Groups of users are a way to classify users together, allowing for shared permissions within the workspace. Users within the same group (also referred to as a role) will have homogenous permissions. Users can belong to multiple groups simultaneously.

Similar to users, groups can be assigned one of three permission levels for a specific item.

- Viewer: read-only access.
- Writer: read and write access.
- Admin: read and write access, and can manage permissions and new admins.
