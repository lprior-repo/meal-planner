## Database manager

The Manager button will show up for every database resource in the Resources tab:
![Database Manager Button](./database_manager_button.png)

You can explore and manage your database tables with all CRUD operations. You can create and delete tables with support for foreign keys.  
If you need finer control, you can use the SQL interactive REPL on the bottom.
