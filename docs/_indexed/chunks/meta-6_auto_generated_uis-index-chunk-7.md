## Saved inputs

Each [deployed](./meta-0_draft_and_deploy-index.md) script or flow can have its own saved inputs.

From a deployed script or flow, fill inputs and click on the `Save Current Input` button to save the inputs.

You can then reuse them by clicking on the input and then 'Use Input'. It's an easy way to quickly use recurrent inputs without having to enter pre-set settings or creating an [app](../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).

Each saved input can be named and 'Shared' with the users having [access](./meta-16_roles_and_permissions-index.md) to the script or flow.
