## Managing sticky notes

### Editing content

Double-click any note to edit its content. Notes support GitHub-flavored Markdown (GHMd) for formatting.

### Customizing appearance

Each note has an action bar in the top-right corner with the following options:

- **Color picker**: Change note color (supports both light and dark themes)
- **Lock icon**: Lock the note to prevent accidental editing or movement
- **Delete button**: Remove the note from the flow

### Positioning notes

Drag notes freely around the canvas to position them where most relevant. Locked notes cannot be moved until unlocked.
