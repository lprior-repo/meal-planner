## Create Shopping Lists
You have three options to create a shopping list

1. Open a recipe of your choice. From the context menu choose `Add to Shoppinglist` and create a new list with the recipe already added.
2. After adding recipes to the meal plan you can click the little shopping cart icon to add the recipes to the shopping list.
   They will be shown below the plan, from there you can open a new shopping list with them.
3. The last option is to open the shopping list page and click the little plus icon to create a new list.
