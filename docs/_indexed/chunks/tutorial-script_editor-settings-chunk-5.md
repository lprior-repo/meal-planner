## Triggers

Triggers allow you to automate the execution of your scripts based on various events or conditions.

### Webhooks

Each Script and Flow created in Windmill gets autogenerated webhooks. The webhooks depend on how they are triggered, and what their return values are.

	/>
</div>

### Schedules

Schedules let you run your script at specified intervals or times, perfect for recurring tasks or periodic data updates.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		title="Schedules"
		description="Scheduling allows you to define schedules for Scripts and Flows, automatically running them at set frequencies."

### Routes

Windmill supports custom HTTP routes to trigger a script or flow.

### Websocket

Windmill can connect to WebSocket servers and trigger runnables (scripts, flows) when a message is received.

</div>

### Postgres

Windmill can connect to a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and trigger runnables (scripts, flows) in response to database transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on specified tables, schemas, or the entire database.

</div>

### Kafka

Windmill can connect to Kafka brokers and trigger scripts or flows when messages are received on specific topics. This enables real-time processing of events from your Kafka ecosystem.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Kafka triggers"

</div>

### NATS

Windmill can connect to NATS brokers and trigger scripts or flows when messages are received on specific subjects. This enables real-time processing of events from your NATS ecosystem.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="NATS triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from NATS messages."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/nats_triggers"
	/>
</div>

### SQS triggers

Windmill can connect to Amazon SQS queues and trigger scripts or flows when messages are received. This enables event-driven processing from your AWS ecosystem. Preprocessors can transform the SQS message data before it reaches your script or flow.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		title="SQS triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from Amazon SQS messages."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/sqs_triggers"
	/>
</div>

### MQTT triggers

Windmill can connect to an MQTT broker, subscribe to specific topics, and trigger scripts or flows when messages are received, enabling event-driven processing. Preprocessors can transform the MQTT message data before it reaches your script or flow.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="MQTT triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from MQTT broker."

### Email

Scripts and flows can be triggered by email messages sent to a specific email address, leveraging SMTP.
