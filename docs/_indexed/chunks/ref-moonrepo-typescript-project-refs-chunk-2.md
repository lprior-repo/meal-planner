## Preface

Before you dive into this questionably long guide, we'd like to preface with:

- This guide is a living document and will continually be updated with best practices and frequently asked questions. Keep returning to learn more!
- This guide assumes a basic level knowledge of TypeScript and how it works.
- The architecture outlined in this guide assumes that TypeScript is *only* used for typechecking and *not* compiling. However, supporting compilation should be as easy as modifying a handful of compiler options.
- Although this guide exists within moon's documentation, it *does not* require moon. We've kept all implementation details generic enough for it be used in any repository, but have also included many notes on how moon would improve this experience.
