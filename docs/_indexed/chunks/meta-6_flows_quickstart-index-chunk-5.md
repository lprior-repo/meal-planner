## Triggers

There are several ways to trigger a flow with Windmill.

1. The most direct one is from the [autogenerated UI provided by Windmill](./meta-6_auto_generated_uis-index.md). It is the one you will see from the flow editor.
2. A similar but more customized way is to use Windmill Apps using the [App editor](./meta-7_apps_quickstart-index.md).
3. We saw above that you can trigger flows using [schedules](./meta-1_scheduling-index.md) that you can check from the [Runs](./meta-5_monitor_past_and_future_runs-index.md) page. One special way to use scheduling is to combine it with [trigger scripts](./concept-flows-10-flow-trigger.md).
4. [Execute flows from the CLI](./meta-3_cli-index.md) to trigger your flows from your terminal.
5. [Trigger the flow from another flow](./meta-8_triggers-index.md#trigger-from-flows).
6. Using [trigger scripts](./concept-flows-10-flow-trigger.md) to trigger only if a condition has been met.
7. [Webhooks](./meta-4_webhooks-index.md). Each Flow created in the app gets autogenerated webhooks. You can see them once you flow is saved. You can even [trigger flows without leaving Slack](/blog/handler-slack-commands)!

You can test your triggers in test mode:
