Although moon is currently focusing on the JavaScript ecosystem, our long-term vision is to be a multi-language task runner and monorepo management tool. To that end, we've designed our languages to work like plugins, where their functionality is implemented in isolation, and is *opt-in*.

> We do not support third-party language plugins at this time, but are working towards it!
