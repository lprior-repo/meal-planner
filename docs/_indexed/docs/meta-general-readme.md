**Designed for both human and AI consumption.** Each doc links to related docs, making it easy to navigate whether you're a person reading or an AI agent following the thread.

## Essential Reads (5 min)

**New to the project?** Start here:

1. [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ops-general-architecture.md) - How code is organized (domain-based, binaries, flows)
2. [MOON_CI_PIPELINE.md](./ops-general-moon-ci-pipeline.md) - How to build and test locally

## Setup (One-Time)

3. [FATSECRET_OAUTH_SETUP.md](./tutorial-general-fatsecret-oauth-setup.md) - Connect FatSecret account (5-10 min)

## Features

- [RECIPE_IMPORT_PIPELINE.md](./concept-general-recipe-import-pipeline.md) - Auto-import recipes from URLs

## For Developers

- [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) - AI agent workflow (issue tracking, credentials, deployment)
- [AI_DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM.md](./concept-general-ai-documentation-system.md) - Documentation design for AI and humans

## External References

- [../docs/fatsecret/](../docs/fatsecret/) - FatSecret API reference (auto-generated)
- [../docs/tandoor/](../docs/tandoor/) - Tandoor API reference (auto-generated)
- [../docs/windmill/](../docs/windmill/) - Windmill reference (official docs)

## Design for AI + Humans

Each doc:
- **Answers one question clearly**
- **Links to 2-3 related docs** (so you never get stuck)
- **Uses headings, tables, code** (scannable for humans, structured for AI)
- **Stays under 1500 words** (focused, no walls of text)
- **Points to next steps** (clear navigation)

See: [AI_DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM.md](./concept-general-ai-documentation-system.md) for how this works
