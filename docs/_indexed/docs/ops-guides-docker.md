## Requirements

The first requirement, which is very important, is adding `.moon/cache` to the workspace root `.dockerignore` (moon assumes builds are running from the root). Not all files in `.moon/cache` are portable across machines/environments, so copying these file into Docker will definitely cause interoperability issues.

.dockerignore

```
.moon/cache
```

The other requirement depends on how you want to integrate Git with Docker. Since moon executes `git` commands under the hood, there are some special considerations to be aware of when running moon within Docker. There's 2 scenarios to choose from:

1. (recommended) Add the `.git` folder to `.dockerignore`, so that it's not `COPY`'d. moon will continue to work just fine, albeit with some functionality disabled, like caching.
2. Ensure that the `git` library is installed in the container, and copy the `.git` folder with `COPY`. moon will work with full functionality, but it will increase the overall size of the image because of caching.

## Creating a `Dockerfile`

> **Info:** Our [`moon docker file`](/docs/commands/docker/file) command can automatically generate a `Dockerfile` based on this guide! We suggest generating the file then reading the guide below to understand what's going on.

We're very familiar with how tedious `Dockerfile`s are to write and maintain, so in an effort to reduce this headache, we've built a handful of tools to make this process much easier. With moon, we'll take advantage of Docker's layer caching and staged builds as much as possible.

With that being said, there's many approaches you can utilize, depending on your workflow (we'll document them below):

- Running `moon docker` commands *before* running `docker run|build` commands.
- Running `moon docker` commands *within* the `Dockerfile`.
- Using multi-staged or non-staged (standard) builds.
- Something else unique to your setup!

> **Warning:** This guide and our Docker approach is merely a suggestion and is not a requirement for using moon with Docker! Feel free to use this as a starting point, or not at all. Choose the approach that works best for you!

### What we're trying to avoid

Before we dive into writing a perfect `Dockerfile`, we'll briefly talk about the pain points we're trying to avoid. In the context of Node.js and monorepo's, you may be familiar with having to `COPY` each individual `package.json` in the monorepo before installing `node_modules`, to effectively use layer caching. This is very brittle, as each new application or package is created, every `Dockerfile` in the monorepo will need to be modified to account for this new `package.json`.

Furthermore, we'll have to follow a similar process for *only copying source files* necessary for the build or `CMD` to complete. This is *very tedious*, so most developers simply use `COPY . .` and forget about it. Copying the entire monorepo is costly, especially as it grows.

As an example, we'll use moon's official repository. The `Dockerfile` would look something like the following.

```dockerfile
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /app

## Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

## Copy moon files
COPY ./.moon ./.moon

## Copy all package.json's and lockfiles
COPY ./packages/cli/package.json ./packages/cli/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-linux-arm64-gnu/package.json ./packages/core-linux-arm64-gnu/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-linux-arm64-musl/package.json ./packages/core-linux-arm64-musl/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-linux-x64-gnu/package.json ./packages/core-linux-x64-gnu/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-linux-x64-musl/package.json ./packages/core-linux-x64-musl/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-macos-arm64/package.json ./packages/core-macos-arm64/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-macos-x64/package.json ./packages/core-macos-x64/package.json
COPY ./packages/core-windows-x64-msvc/package.json ./packages/core-windows-x64-msvc/package.json
COPY ./packages/runtime/package.json ./packages/runtime/package.json
COPY ./packages/types/package.json ./packages/types/package.json
COPY ./package.json ./package.json
COPY ./yarn.lock ./yarn.lock
COPY ./.yarn ./.yarn
COPY ./.yarnrc.yml ./yarnrc.yml

## Install toolchain and dependencies
## In non-moon repos: yarn install
RUN moon docker setup

## Copy project and required files
## Or COPY . .
COPY ./packages/types ./packages/types
COPY ./packages/runtime ./packages/runtime

## Build the target
RUN moon run runtime:build
```

For such a small monorepo, this already looks too confusing!!! Let's remedy this by utilizing moon itself to the fullest!

### Scaffolding the bare minimum

The first step in this process is to only copy the bare minimum of files necessary for installing dependencies (Node.js modules, etc). This is typically manifests (`package.json`), lockfiles (`yarn.lock`, etc), and any configuration (`.yarnrc.yml`, etc).

This can all be achieved with the [`moon docker scaffold`](/docs/commands/docker/scaffold) command, which scaffolds a skeleton of the repository structure, with only necessary files (the above). Let's update our `Dockerfile` usage.

#### Non-staged

This assumes [`moon docker scaffold <project>`](/docs/commands/docker/scaffold) is ran outside of the `Dockerfile`.

```dockerfile
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /app

## Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

## Copy workspace skeleton
COPY ./.moon/docker/workspace .

## Install toolchain and dependencies
RUN moon docker setup
```

### Multi-staged

```dockerfile
#### BASE
FROM node:latest AS base

WORKDIR /app

## Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

### SKELETON
FROM base AS skeleton

## Copy entire repository and scaffold
COPY . .
RUN moon docker scaffold <project>

### BUILD
FROM base AS build

## Copy workspace skeleton
COPY --from=skeleton /app/.moon/docker/workspace .

## Install toolchain and dependencies
RUN moon docker setup
```

And with this, our dependencies will be layer cached effectively! Let's now move onto copying source files.

### Copying necessary source files

The next step is to copy all source files necessary for `CMD` or any `RUN` commands to execute correctly. This typically requires copying all source files for the project *and* all source files of the project's dependencies... NOT the entire repository!

Luckily our [`moon docker scaffold <project>`](/docs/commands/docker/scaffold) command has already done this for us! Let's continue updating our `Dockerfile` to account for this, by appending the following:

#### Non-staged

```dockerfile
## Copy source files
COPY ./.moon/docker/sources .

## Build something (optional)
RUN moon run <project>:<task>
```

### Multi-staged

```dockerfile
## Copy source files
COPY --from=skeleton /app/.moon/docker/sources .

## Build something (optional)
RUN moon run <project>:<task>
```

> **Info:** If you need to copy additional files for your commands to run successfully, you can configure the `docker.scaffold.include` setting in [`.moon/workspace.yaml`](/docs/config/workspace#scaffold) (entire workspace) or [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project#scaffold) (per project).

### Pruning extraneous files

Now that we've ran a command or built an artifact, we should prune the Docker environment to remove unneeded files and folders. We can do this with the [`moon docker prune`](/docs/commands/docker/prune) command, which *must be ran* within the context of a `Dockerfile`!

```dockerfile
## Prune workspace
RUN moon docker prune
```

When ran, this command will do the following, in order:

- Remove extraneous dependencies (`node_modules`) for unfocused projects.
- Install production only dependencies for the projects that were scaffolded.

> **Info:** This process can be customized using the `docker.prune` setting in [`.moon/workspace.yaml`](/docs/config/workspace#prune).

### Final result

And with this moon integration, we've reduced the original `Dockerfile` of 35 lines to 18 lines, a reduction of almost 50%. The original file can also be seen as `O(n)`, as each new manifest requires cascading updates, while the moon approach is `O(1)`!

#### Non-staged

```dockerfile
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /app

## Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

## Copy workspace skeleton
COPY ./.moon/docker/workspace .

## Install toolchain and dependencies
RUN moon docker setup

## Copy source files
COPY ./.moon/docker/sources .

## Build something (optional)
RUN moon run <project>:<task>

## Prune workspace
RUN moon docker prune

## CMD
```

### Multi-staged

```dockerfile
#### BASE
FROM node:latest AS base

WORKDIR /app

## Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

### SKELETON
FROM base AS skeleton

## Copy entire repository and scaffold
COPY . .
RUN moon docker scaffold <project>

### BUILD
FROM base AS build

## Copy workspace skeleton
COPY --from=skeleton /app/.moon/docker/workspace .

## Install toolchain and dependencies
RUN moon docker setup

## Copy source files
COPY --from=skeleton /app/.moon/docker/sources .

## Build something (optional)
RUN moon run <project>:<task>

## Prune workspace
RUN moon docker prune

## CMD
```

## Running `docker` commands

When running `docker` commands, they *must* be ran from moon's workspace root (typically the repository root) so that the project graph and all `moon docker` commands resolve correctly.

```shell
docker build .
```

If you're `Dockerfile`s are located within each applicable project, use the `-f` argument.

```shell
docker run -f ./apps/client/Dockerfile .
```

## Troubleshooting

### Supporting `node:alpine` images

If you're trying to use the `node:alpine` image with moon's [integrated toolchain](/docs/concepts/toolchain), you'll need to set the `MOON_TOOLCHAIN_FORCE_GLOBALS` environment variable in the Docker image to disable moon's toolchain. This is required as Node.js does not provide pre-built binaries for the Alpine target, so installing the Node.js toolchain will fail.

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine

ENV MOON_TOOLCHAIN_FORCE_GLOBALS=true
```
