{"id":"MP-i15","title":"CRITICAL: 3-legged OAuth binaries incompatible with Windmill architecture","description":"CONFIRMED: Multiple scripts require DATABASE_URL which is not available in Windmill workers.\n\n**Scripts that use TokenStorage (require DATABASE_URL):**\n1. fatsecret_oauth_start - BROKEN (stores pending token in DB)\n2. fatsecret_oauth_complete - BROKEN (retrieves pending token from DB)\n3. fatsecret_oauth_callback - BROKEN (handles OAuth callback)\n4. fatsecret_get_profile - BROKEN (reads access token from DB)\n5. fatsecret_get_token - BROKEN (retrieves stored token)\n\n**Impact:**\n- OAuth flow cannot be completed via Windmill\n- Profile access is broken\n- Any script that needs to retrieve stored OAuth tokens fails\n\n**Scripts that work (accept tokens as input):**\n- All diary scripts (food_entries_get, food_entry_create, etc.)\n- All favorites scripts\n- All exercise scripts\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe architecture assumes tokens are stored in PostgreSQL, but:\n1. DATABASE_URL is not set in Windmill workers\n2. Even if it was, Windmill has its own resource system for storing credentials\n\n**Fix Options:**\n1. **Recommended:** Redesign OAuth flow for Windmill:\n   - oauth_start should return tokens to be stored as Windmill Resource\n   - oauth_complete should take pending token as input, return access token for Windmill Resource\n   - get_profile should accept access_token/access_secret as input like diary scripts\n\n2. **Alternative:** Set DATABASE_URL in Windmill workers (but this defeats the purpose of Windmill Resources)","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-30T22:41:40.41883235-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T22:45:24.964923127-06:00","created_by":"lewis","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"MP-i15","depends_on_id":"MP-3cb","type":"relates-to","created_at":"2025-12-30T23:04:11.846699662-06:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
