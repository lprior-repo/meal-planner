Route Handler (line ~94 in web.gleam)\nUncomment the route:\n```gleam\n[\"recipes\", id, \"edit\"] -\u003e edit_recipe_page(id, ctx)\n```\n\n### 2. Edit Page Function\nAdd after `new_recipe_page()` function (around line 410):\n\nKey features:\n- Loads existing recipe by ID\n- Pre-populates form fields with current values\n- Uses `_method=PUT` for form method override\n- Includes all recipe fields: name, category, servings, macros, FODMAP level, vertical compliant, ingredients, instructions\n- JavaScript for dynamic ingredient/instruction management\n\nHelper functions needed:\n- `category_option(value, label, current)` - Sets selected attribute for category dropdown\n- `fodmap_option(value, label, current_level)` - Sets selected attribute for FODMAP dropdown\n\n### 3. API Handler Updates\nModified `api_recipe` function (around line 1863) to handle:\n- GET: Return recipe JSON\n- POST with `_method=PUT`: Update recipe using `storage.save_recipe` (upsert)\n- POST with `_method=DELETE`: Delete recipe\n- DELETE: Delete recipe\n\n### 4. Dependencies\nRequires:\n- `storage.save_recipe` (exists, acts as upsert)\n- `storage.delete_recipe` (exists)\n\n## Current Blocker\nThe codebase does not currently compile due to unrelated work-in-progress changes:\n- Missing fields on UsdaFood type\n- Syntax errors in storage.gleam\n- Type mismatches in food logging code\n\nThese errors prevent testing the edit page implementation.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Fix compilation errors in storage.gleam and web.gleam\n2. Apply the edit_recipe_page implementation\n3. Test the edit page manually\n4. Verify form submission and recipe updates\n5.
