OAuth token expired/invalid (most likely)\n2. FatSecret API failing silently (error response being swallowed)\n3. Date format mismatch\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Verify OAuth token in database is valid\n2. Add detailed logging to client.gleam to see raw FatSecret response\n3. Test FatSecret API directly with curl using stored token","notes":"ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:\n\nThe diary client's get_food_entries() function (diary/client.gleam:169-247) has a critical error silencing pattern at lines 203-220:\n\n```gleam\ndecode.one_of(\n  // Strategy 1: Array format\n  decode.at([\"food_entries\", \"food_entry\"], decode.list(...)),\n  [\n    // Strategy 2: Single entry\n    decode.at([\"food_entries\", \"food_entry\"], single_entry_to_list_decoder()),\n    // Strategy 3: Missing food_entry or null\n    decode.at([\"food_entries\"], decode.success([])),\n    // ❌ PROBLEM: Strategy 4 ALWAYS matches and returns empty list!\n    decode.success([]),  // \u003c-- Swallows ALL decode errors!\n  ],\n)\n```\n\nISSUE: When FatSecret API returns HTTP 200 with an error response JSON (e.g., invalid/expired OAuth token), the decoder:\n1. Tries strategies 1-3 (all fail because response is error, not food_entries)\n2. Falls back to Strategy 4 `decode.success([])` which ALWAYS succeeds\n3. Silently returns Ok([]) instead of Error\n\nThis masks OAuth token expiration, API errors, and other problems.\n\nEVIDENCE: Logging at lines 174-246 shows:\n- HTTP 200 ✓ (so no network error)\n- Response logged as valid JSON ✓ (so not a parsing error at HTTP level)\n- But entries count is 0 (parsed as empty instead of error)\n\nSOLUTION: Remove Strategy 4 fallback and handle errors properly.

NOT USED by handlers yet\n- `parse_int_parameter` - Duplicate of `helpers.parse_int_param`\n- `get_string_parameter` - Duplicate of `helpers.get_query_param`\n\n### Consolidation Opportunities\n\n#### Opportunity 1: Query Parameter Builder Function\n**Proposal:** Extract to `shared/query_builders.gleam`\n```gleam\npub fn parse_list_query_params(\n  req: wisp.Request,\n  additional_params: List(String),\n) -\u003e QueryParams {\n  let query_params = wisp.get_query(req)\n  let limit = parse_int_parameter(query_params, \"limit\")\n  let offset = parse_int_parameter(query_params, \"offset\")\n  let query = get_string_parameter(query_params, \"query\")\n  // ... parse additional_params dynamically\n  QueryParams(limit:, offset:, query:, extra:)\n}\n```\n**Lines Saved:** 72-90 lines\n\n#### Opportunity 2: Paginated List Response Helper\n**Proposal:** Extract to `helpers.gleam` or `shared/response_encoders.gleam`\n```gleam\npub fn encode_paginated_list(\n  response: PaginatedApiResponse(a),\n  encode_fn: fn(a) -\u003e json.Json,\n) -\u003e wisp.Response {\n  json.array(response.results, encode_fn)\n  |\u003e paginated_response(response.count, response.next, response.previous)\n  |\u003e json.to_string\n  |\u003e wisp.json_response(200)\n}\n```\n**Lines Saved:** 99 lines\n\n#### Opportunity 3: Authenticated Pipeline Helper (CRITICAL)\n**Proposal:** Add to `helpers.gleam`\n```gleam\npub fn with_authenticated_api(\n  api_call: fn(ClientConfig) -\u003e Result(a, Nil),\n  encode_fn: fn(a) -\u003e json.Json,\n  status: Int,\n  error_msg: String,\n) -\u003e wisp.Response {\n  case get_authenticated_client() {\n    Ok(config) -\u003e {\n      case api_call(config) {\n        Ok(data) -\u003e encode_fn(data) |\u003e json.to_string |\u003e wisp.json_response(status)\n        Error(_) -\u003e error_response(500, error_msg)\n      }\n    }\n    Error(resp) -\u003e resp\n  }\n}\n```\n**Lines Saved:** 300+ lines\n**Note:** `flatten_authenticated_result` already exists but NOT used in handlers!\n\n#### Opportunity 4: Generic CRUD Handler Factory (ADVANCED)\n**Proposal:** Factory function for resource handlers\n```gleam\npub fn crud_handler_by_id(\n  id_string: String,\n  parse_id_fn: fn(String) -\u003e Result(a, Nil),\n  get_fn: fn(a) -\u003e Result(b, Nil),\n  update_fn: fn(a, c) -\u003e Result(b, Nil),\n  delete_fn: fn(a) -\u003e Result(Nil, Nil),\n  encode_fn: fn(b) -\u003e json.Json,\n  decode_update_fn: fn(dynamic.Dynamic) -\u003e Result(c, String),\n) -\u003e fn(wisp.Request, String) -\u003e wisp.Response\n```\n**Lines Saved:** 117+ lines (ID routing logic)\n\n### Total Consolidation Potential\n- **Query param parsing:** 72-90 lines\n- **Paginated responses:** 99 lines\n- **Authentication pipeline:** 300+ lines\n- **ID routing:** 117 lines\n- **Encode + respond:** 90 lines\n\n**TOTAL: 678-696 lines** (conservative estimate)\n\n### Recommendations\n\n#### Phase 1: Low-Hanging Fruit (Immediate)\n1. Use existing `shared/query_builders` functions in handlers\n2. Create `encode_paginated_list()` helper\n3. Migrate handlers to use `flatten_authenticated_result()` (already exists!)\n\n#### Phase 2: Pipeline Consolidation (Next)\n1. Extract `parse_list_query_params()` to query_builders\n2. Create `with_authenticated_api()` wrapper\n3. Remove duplicate param parsing logic\n\n#### Phase 3: Advanced Abstraction (Future)\n1. CRUD handler factory for standard resource patterns\n2. Generic ID routing middleware\n3. Type-safe query param builders with validation\n\n### Files Requiring Changes (Phase 1)\n- `src/meal_planner/web/handlers/tandoor/foods.gleam`\n- `src/meal_planner/web/handlers/tandoor/recipes.gleam`\n- `src/meal_planner/web/handlers/tandoor/shopping_lists.gleam`\n- `src/meal_planner/web/handlers/tandoor/ingredients.gleam`\n- `src/meal_planner/web/handlers/tandoor/keywords.gleam`\n- `src/meal_planner/web/handlers/tandoor/units.gleam`\n- `src/meal_planner/web/handlers/tandoor/steps.gleam`\n- `src/meal_planner/web/handlers/tandoor/meal_plans.gleam`\n- `src/meal_planner/web/handlers/fatsecret/brands.gleam`\n\n**9 handlers × ~75 lines average reduction = 675 lines eliminated**","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-20T15:05:16.378995878Z","updated_at":"2025-12-24T08:30:41.163236794-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"meal-planner-5lxf","depends_on_id":"meal-planner-z31r","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-20T15:05:16.379767539Z","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-24T08:30:41.163236794-06:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"meal-planner-b7gh","title":"REFACTORER: FatSecret Diary TUI - Code Optimization (BLUE Phase)","description":"Refactor the FatSecret Diary TUI implementation for idiomatic Gleam after all tests pass (BLUE phase). Focus on code clarity, module extraction, and performance optimization without changing behavior.\n\nLOCATION: src/meal_planner/cli/screens/ (multiple files)\n\nREFACTORING AREAS:\n\n1. **Helper Module Extraction** (50 lines):\n   - Create fatsecret_diary_helpers.gleam\n   - daily_nutrition_totals() with list.fold\n   - organize_entries_by_meal() with list.map per meal type\n   - macro_comparison() calculation\n   - create_display_entry() formatting\n\n2. **View Component Split** (250 lines):\n   - Create fatsecret_diary_views.gleam\n   - render_header(), render_meal_section(), render_daily_totals(), render_search_popup(), render_edit_popup(), render_delete_confirmation(), render_date_picker(), render_footer()\n   - Main view() becomes 30-line dispatcher\n\n3. **Keyboard Handler Extraction** (80 lines):\n   - Create fatsecret_diary_keyboard.gleam\n   - handle_key_press() router\n   - handle_main_view_key(), handle_search_popup_key(), handle_date_picker_key(), handle_edit_popup_key(), handle_delete_confirm_key()\n\n4. **State Constructor Functions** (40 lines):\n   - init_diary_model() - eliminate boilerplate\n   - clear_error(), set_error() helpers\n   - view_state constructors\n\n5. **Message Handler Grouping** (60 lines):\n   - Reorganize update() by message family\n   - Extract handle_date_navigate(), handle_add_entry_start(), handle_fetch_entries()\n   - Reduce nesting from 4 levels to 2 levels\n\n6. **Type Conversion Functions** (30 lines):\n   - meal_type_to_display(): MealType → String\n   - comparison_status_to_color(): ComparisonStatus → Color\n   - comparison_status_to_symbol(): ComparisonStatus → String\n\n7. **Validation Module** (40 lines):\n   - Create fatsecret_diary_validation.gleam\n   - validate_servings(String) → Result(Float, String)\n   - validate_date(String) → Result(Int, String)\n\nSUCCESS METRICS:\n- Main file: 800 lines → 350 lines (56% reduction)\n- Update function: 400 lines → 180 lines (55% reduction)\n- View function: 300 lines → 80 lines (73% reduction)\n- Max nesting: 5 levels → 2 levels\n- Functions: 8 → 25+\n- Modules: 1 → 4\n- gleam format --check: PASSING\n- All tests still pass: YES\n- Zero behavior changes: YES","design":"## BLUE Phase Refactoring Strategy\n\nAfter all tests pass and implementation works, refactor for:\n1. **Idiomatic Gleam**: Replace manual recursion with `list.map`, `list.filter`, `list.fold`\n2. **Pipe Clarity**: Convert nested case to pipeline chains\n3. **Module Extraction**: Pull out 200+ lines into reusable helpers\n4. **Type Safety**: Replace String conversions with smarter types\n5. **Error Handling**: Consolidate error paths (DRY principle)\n\n## Refactoring Opportunities\n\n### 1. Calculation Functions → Helper Module\n\nCreate `src/meal_planner/cli/screens/fatsecret_diary_helpers.gleam`:\n\n```gleam\n// Extract 50 lines of calculation logic\npub fn daily_nutrition_totals(entries_by_meal: List(MealSection)) -\u003e NutritionTotals {\n  entries_by_meal\n  |\u003e list.flat_map(fn(section) { section.entries })\n  |\u003e list.fold(NutritionTotals(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), fn(acc, entry) {\n    NutritionTotals(\n      acc.calories +. entry.calories,\n      acc.protein +. entry.protein,\n      acc.carbohydrate +. entry.carbohydrate,\n      acc.fat +. entry.fat,\n    )\n  })\n}\n\npub fn organize_entries_by_meal(entries: List(diary_types.FoodEntry)) -\u003e List(MealSection) {\n  [diary_types.Breakfast, diary_types.Lunch, diary_types.Dinner, diary_types.Snack]\n  |\u003e list.map(fn(meal_type) {\n    MealSection(\n      meal_type:,\n      entries: entries\n        |\u003e list.filter(fn(e) { e.meal == meal_type })\n        |\u003e list.map(create_display_entry),\n      section_totals: calculate_meal_totals(...),\n    )\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. View Components → Reusable Modules\n\nCreate `src/meal_planner/cli/screens/fatsecret_diary_views.gleam`:\n\n```gleam\npub fn render_header(current_date: Int) -\u003e shore.Node(DiaryMsg) { ... }\npub fn render_meal_section(section: MealSection) -\u003e shore.Node(DiaryMsg) { ... }\npub fn render_daily_totals(totals: NutritionTotals, targets: Option(NutritionTarget)) -\u003e shore.Node(DiaryMsg) { ... }\npub fn render_search_popup(state: SearchState) -\u003e shore.Node(DiaryMsg) { ... }\npub fn render_edit_popup(state: EditState) -\u003e shore.Node(DiaryMsg) { ... }\npub fn render_delete_confirmation(entry_id: FoodEntryId, entry: DisplayEntry) -\u003e shore.Node(DiaryMsg) { ... }\npub fn render_date_picker(view_state: ViewState) -\u003e shore.Node(DiaryMsg) { ... }\npub fn render_footer() -\u003e shore.Node(DiaryMsg) { ... }\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- Main view() function becomes 30 lines (dispatch on view_state)\n- Each render function testable independently\n- Easier to refactor UI without touching update logic\n\n### 3. Keyboard Handling → Extract Router\n\nCreate `src/meal_planner/cli/screens/fatsecret_diary_keyboard.gleam`:\n\n```gleam\npub fn handle_key_press(model: DiaryModel, key: String) -\u003e DiaryMsg {\n  case model.view_state {\n    MainView -\u003e handle_main_view_key(key)\n    SearchPopup -\u003e handle_search_popup_key(key)\n    DatePicker(_) -\u003e handle_date_picker_key(key)\n    EditAmount(_) -\u003e handle_edit_popup_key(key)\n    ConfirmDelete(_) -\u003e handle_delete_confirm_key(key)\n  }\n}\n\n// 50+ lines of specific handlers extracted\nfn handle_main_view_key(key: String) -\u003e DiaryMsg { ... }\nfn handle_search_popup_key(key: String) -\u003e DiaryMsg { ... }\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- Update function drops 60 lines of key handling\n- Keyboard layout documented in one place\n- Easy to add/modify bindings\n\n### 4. State Helpers → Constructor Functions\n\n```gleam\n// Reduce boilerplate in init and update\npub fn init_diary_model(config: Config) -\u003e DiaryModel {\n  DiaryModel(\n    current_date: today_as_date_int(),\n    entries_by_meal: [],\n    nutrition_targets: None,\n    daily_totals: NutritionTotals(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0),\n    search_state: SearchState(False, \"\", [], 0, False),\n    edit_state: None,\n    delete_confirmation: None,\n    view_state: MainView,\n    loading: False,\n    error: None,\n    food_cache: dict.new(),\n    pagination: PaginationState(0, 50),\n  )\n}\n\npub fn clear_error(model: DiaryModel) -\u003e DiaryModel {\n  DiaryModel(..model, error: None)\n}\n\npub fn set_error(model: DiaryModel, msg: String) -\u003e DiaryModel {\n  DiaryModel(..model, error: Some(msg), loading: False)\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Message Handling → Pattern Grouping\n\nReorganize update function:\n\n```gleam\npub fn update(model: DiaryModel, msg: DiaryMsg) -\u003e #(DiaryModel, List(fn() -\u003e DiaryMsg)) {\n  case msg {\n    // Date navigation (6 cases)\n    DateNavigatePrevious -\u003e handle_date_navigate(model, -1)\n    DateNavigateNext -\u003e handle_date_navigate(model, 1)\n    DateJumpToToday -\u003e handle_date_jump_today(model)\n    DateShowPicker -\u003e handle_date_show_picker(model)\n    DateConfirmPicker(date_str) -\u003e handle_date_confirm_picker(model, date_str)\n    DateCancelPicker -\u003e handle_date_cancel_picker(model)\n    \n    // Entry management (12 cases)\n    AddEntryStart -\u003e handle_add_entry_start(model)\n    SearchFoodStarted(q) -\u003e handle_search_started(model, q)\n    // ... etc\n    \n    // Server operations (8 cases)\n    FetchEntriesForDate -\u003e handle_fetch_entries(model)\n    GotDailyEntries(r) -\u003e handle_got_daily_entries(model, r)\n    // ... etc\n  }\n}\n\n// Helper functions reduce nesting\nfn handle_date_navigate(model: DiaryModel, offset: Int) -\u003e #(DiaryModel, List(...)) {\n  let new_date = model.current_date + offset\n  let updated_model = DiaryModel(..model, current_date: new_date)\n  #(updated_model, [fetch_entries_for_date(new_date)])\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Type Conversions → Explicit Functions\n\n```gleam\n// Instead of inline conversion strings\npub fn meal_type_to_display(meal: diary_types.MealType) -\u003e String {\n  case meal {\n    diary_types.Breakfast -\u003e \"BREAKFAST\"\n    diary_types.Lunch -\u003e \"LUNCH\"\n    diary_types.Dinner -\u003e \"DINNER\"\n    diary_types.Snack -\u003e \"SNACKS\"\n  }\n}\n\npub fn comparison_status_to_color(status: ComparisonStatus) -\u003e style.Color {\n  case status {\n    Under -\u003e style.Red\n    Met -\u003e style.Green\n    Over -\u003e style.Red\n  }\n}\n\npub fn comparison_status_to_symbol(status: ComparisonStatus) -\u003e String {\n  case status {\n    Under -\u003e \"▼ Under\"\n    Met -\u003e \"✓ On Track\"\n    Over -\u003e \"▲ Over\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Validation \u0026 Parsing → Dedicated Module\n\nCreate `src/meal_planner/cli/screens/fatsecret_diary_validation.gleam`:\n\n```gleam\npub fn validate_servings(input: String) -\u003e Result(Float, String) {\n  input\n  |\u003e string.trim\n  |\u003e float.parse\n  |\u003e result.map_error(fn(_) { \"Invalid number\" })\n  |\u003e result.try(fn(n) {\n    case n \u003e. 0.0 {\n      True -\u003e Ok(n)\n      False -\u003e Error(\"Servings must be greater than 0\")\n    }\n  })\n}\n\npub fn validate_date(input: String) -\u003e Result(Int, String) {\n  case diary_types.date_to_int(input) {\n    Ok(date_int) -\u003e Ok(date_int)\n    Error(_) -\u003e Error(\"Invalid date format. Use YYYY-MM-DD\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Code Metrics (Before → After)\n\n| Metric | Before | After | Reduction |\n|--------|--------|-------|-----------|\n| Main file lines | 800 | 350 | 56% |\n| Update function | 400 | 180 | 55% |\n| View function | 300 | 80 | 73% |\n| Nesting depth | 5 | 2 | 60% |\n| Functions (total) | 8 | 25+ | +212% |\n| Module count | 1 | 4 | +300% |\n\n## Gleam Formatting \u0026 Standards\n\nAll refactored code must:\n- Pass `gleam format --check`\n- Use `|\u003e` pipeline operator consistently\n- Extract \u003e20 line functions\n- Document public functions with `///` comments\n- Use exhaustive pattern matching (no catch-all `_` unless necessary)\n- Label all functions with \u003e2 arguments\n- Use opaque types for domain concepts\n\n## Testing Refactoring\n\nNo test changes required:\n- Behavior remains identical\n- API contracts unchanged\n- Same test assertions pass","status":"tombstone","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-20T13:25:06.023591765Z","updated_at":"2025-12-24T08:30:41.163236794-06:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T08:30:41.163236794-06:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}
